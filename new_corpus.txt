Faults
Faults kill. Faults start ﬁres. Faults force interruptions. Faults create voltage
sags. Tree trimming, surge arresters, animal guards, cable replacements:
these tools reduce faults. We cannot eliminate all faults, but appropriate
standards and maintenance practices help in the battle. When faults occur,
we have ways to reduce their impacts. This chapter focuses on the general
characteristics of faults and speciﬁc analysis of common fault types with
suggestions on how to reduce them. One of the deﬁnitions of a fault is
(ANSI/IEEE Std. 100-1992):
Fault: A physical condition that causes a device, a component, or an ele-
ment to fail to perform in a required manner; for example, a short circuit or
a broken wire.
A fault almost always involves a short circuit between energized phase
conductors or between a phase and ground. A fault may be a bolted con-
nection or may have some impedance in the fault connection. The term
“fault” is often used synonymously with the term “short circuit” deﬁned as
(ANSI/IEEE Std. 100-1992):
Short circuit: An abnormal connection (including an arc) of relatively low
impedance, whether made accidentally or intentionally, between two points
of different potential. (Note: The term fault or short-circuit fault is used to
describe a short circuit.)
When a short-circuit fault occurs, the fault path explodes in an intense arc.
Local customers endure an interruption, and customers farther away, a volt-
age sag; faults cause most reliability and power quality problems. Faults kill
and injure line operators. Crew operating practices, equipment, and training
must account for where fault arcs are likely to occur and must minimize
crew exposure.

General Fault Characteristics
There are many causes of faults on distribution circuits. A large EPRI study
was done to characterize distribution faults in the 1980s at 13 utilities mon-

itoring 50 feeders (Burke and Lawrence, 1984; EPRI 1209-1, 1983). The dis-
tribution of permanent fault causes found in the EPRI study is shown in
Figure 7.1. Many of the fault causes are discussed in more detail in this
chapter. Approximately 40% of faults in this study occurred during periods
of adverse weather which included rain, snow and ice.
Distribution faults occur on one phase, on two phases, or on all three
phases. Single-phase faults are the most common. Almost 80% of the faults
measured involved only one phase either in contact with the neutral or with
ground (see Table 7.1). As another data point, measurements on 34.5-kV

feeders found that 75% of faults involved ground (also 54% were phase to
ground, and 15% were phase to phase) (Johnston et al., 1978). Most faults
are single phase because most of the overall length of distribution lines is
single phase, so any fault on single-phase sections would only involve one
phase. Also, on three-phase sections, many types of faults tend to occur from
phase to ground. Equipment faults and animal faults tend to cause line-to-
ground faults. Trees can also cause line-to-ground faults on three-phase
structures, but line-to-line faults are more common. Lightning faults tend to
be two or three phases to ground on three-phase structures.
Figure 7.2 shows fault rates found in various studies for predominantly
overhead circuits. Ninety faults per 100 mi per year (55 faults/100 km/year)
is common for utilities with moderate lightning. Fault rates increase signif-
icantly in higher lightning areas. This type of data is difﬁcult to obtain.
Utilities more commonly track faults that cause sustained interruptions,
interruptions that contribute to reliability indices such as SAIDI (some data
on these faults is shown in Figure 7.3). The actual fault rates are higher than
this because many temporary faults are cleared by reclosing circuit breakers
or reclosers.
Faults are either temporary or permanent. A permanent fault is one where
permanent damage is done to the system. This includes insulator failures,

broken wires, or failed equipment such as transformers or capacitors. Virtu-
ally all faults on underground equipment are permanent. Most equipment
fails to a short circuit. Permanent faults on distribution circuits usually cause
sustained interruptions for some customers. To clear the fault, a fuse, recloser,
or circuit breaker must operate to interrupt the circuit. The most critical
location is the three-phase mains, since a fault on the main feeder will cause
an interruption to all customers on the circuit. A permanent fault also causes
a voltage sag to customers on the feeder and on adjacent feeders. Permanent
faults may cause momentary interruptions for a customer. A common exam-
ple is a fault on a fused lateral (tap). With fuse saving (where an upstream
circuit breaker or recloser attempts to open before the tap fuse blows), a
permanent fault causes a momentary interruption for customers downstream
of the circuit breaker or recloser. After the ﬁrst attempt to save the fuse, if
the fault is still there, the circuit breaker allows the fuse to clear the fault. If
a fault is permanent, all customers on the circuit experience a momentary —
and the customers on the fused lateral experience a sustained interruption.
A temporary fault does not permanently damage any system equipment.
If the circuit is interrupted and then reclosed after a delay, the system oper-
ates normally. Temporary (non-damage) faults make up 50 to 90% of faults
on overhead distribution systems. The causes of temporary faults include
lightning, conductors slapping together in the wind, tree branches that fall
across conductors and then fall or burn off, animals that cause faults and

fall off, and insulator ﬂashovers caused by pollution. Temporary faults are
the main reason that reclosing is used almost universally on distribution
circuit breakers and reclosers (on overhead circuits). Temporary faults will
cause voltage sags for customers on the circuit with the fault and possibly
for customers on adjacent feeders. Temporary faults cause sustained inter-
ruptions if the fault is downstream of a fuse, and fuse saving is not used or
is not successful. For temporary faults on the feeder backbone, all customers
on the circuit are momentarily interrupted. Faults that are normally tempo-
rary can turn into permanent faults. If the fault is allowed to remain too
long, the fault arc can do permanent damage to conductors, insulators, or
other hardware. In addition, the fault current ﬂowing through equipment
can do damage. The most common damage of this type is to connectors or
circuit interrupters such as fuses.
The majority of faults on overhead distribution circuits are temporary. The
data in Figure 7.4 conﬁrms the widely held belief that 50 to 80% of faults
are temporary. This very limited data set shows high lightning areas with
lower percentages of temporary faults. This contradicts the notion that tem-
porary faults are higher in areas with more lightning. Storms with lightning
and wind should cause more temporary faults.
Determining the percentage of faults that are temporary versus permanent
is complicated. For faults that operate fuses, it is easy. If it can be successfully
re-fused without any repair, the fault is temporary:

Circuit breaker or recloser operations are difﬁcult. If fuse blowing is used,
where tap fuses always operate before the circuit breaker or recloser, the
percentage of temporary faults cleared by circuit breakers and reclosers is:
A SCADA system produces these numbers, but if this information is not
available, the percentage can be approximated using circuit breaker count
numbers:
where
n = total number of circuit breaker (or recloser) operations
r = number of reclose attempts before lockout (there are r+1 circuit 
breaker operations during a lockout cycle)
l = number of lockouts
If fuse saving is used, where the circuit breaker operates before lateral fuses,
then it is more difﬁcult to estimate the number of temporary faults. For the
whole circuit (it is not possible to separate the faults on the mains from the
faults on the taps), we can estimate the percentage as follows:
where
s = number of successful reclose sequences
f = number of fuses replaced following repair (not including nuisance 
fuse operations)
f2 = number of fuse operations that are not coincident with circuit breaker 
trips
f2 should be close to zero, since the circuit breaker should operate for all
faults. Assuming f2 is zero (which may have to be done, since this is a difﬁcult
number to obtain) implies no nuisance fuse operations without a circuit
breaker operation. It is difﬁcult for an outage data management system to
properly determine the number of temporary faults.
Faults frequently occur near the peak of the voltage waveform as shown
in Figure 7.5. About 60% of the faults in the EPRI fault study occurred when
the voltage was within 5% of the peak prefault voltage (where the angle was

70 to 90o). This is reasonable. Any insulation failure, whether it be a squirrel
breaching a bushing or a failure in a cable, more likely strikes with the
voltage at or near its peak. Some faults defy this pattern. Lightning faults
happen at any point on the voltage waveform because the fault occurs when
the lightning strikes (although lightning can cause a ﬂashover but not a fault
if the voltage is very close to a zero-crossing of the power-frequency voltage).
Two-phase and three-phase faults create more instances in which the voltage
is not near its peak.
7.2
Fault Calculations
The magnitude of fault current is limited only by the system impedance and
any fault impedance. The system impedance includes the impedances of
wires, cables, and transformers back to the source. For faults involving
ground, the impedance includes paths through the earth and through the
neutral wire. The impedance of the fault depends on the type of fault.
Most distribution primary circuits are radial, with only one source and
one path for fault currents. Figure 7.6 shows equations for calculating fault
currents for common distribution faults.
The equations in Figure 7.6 assume that the positive-sequence impedance
is equal to the negative-sequence impedance. As an example, the impedance
term due to the sequence components for a line-to-line fault is (Z1 + Z2),
which simpliﬁes to 2Z1 when the impedances are assumed to be equal. This
is accurate for virtually all distribution circuits. With a large generator
nearby, the equivalent circuit may have different positive- and negative-

sequence impedances (but that case is usually done on the computer and
not with hand calculations). The maximum currents occur with a bolted fault
where RF is zero. The maximum current for a line-to-line fault is 86.6% of
the maximum three-phase fault current. In all cases, the load current is
ignored. In most cases, load will not signiﬁcantly change results.
The three-phase fault current is almost always the highest magnitude. On
most circuits, the zero-sequence impedance is signiﬁcantly higher than the
positive-sequence impedance. One important location where the line-to-
ground fault current may be higher is at the substation. There are two reasons
for this:
1. A delta – wye transformer is a zero-sequence source. The positive-
sequence impedance includes the impedance of the subtransmission
and transmission system. The zero-sequence impedance does not.
Figure 7.7 shows the sequence diagrams for the positive and zero
sequences. The delta-wye connection forms a zero-sequence source
while the positive-sequence impedance includes the subtransmis-
sion equivalent impedance.
2. If the substation transformer has three-legged core-form construc-
tion, the zero-sequence impedance is lower than its positive-

sequence impedance. Typically, the zero-sequence impedance is 85%
of the positive-sequence impedance, which increases ground-fault
currents by 5.2%.
In cases where the zero-sequence impedance is less than the positive-
sequence impedance, the line-to-ground fault gives the highest phase cur-
rent. The double line-to-ground fault produces the highest-magnitude
ground current.
In order to reduce fault currents for line-to-ground faults, a neutral reactor
on the station transformer is sometimes used. Figure 7.8 shows the equations
for faults involving ground for circuits with a neutral reactor (the line-to-
line fault and the three-phase fault are not affected). A common value for a
neutral reactor is 1 W for 15-kV class distribution circuits.
The impedance seen by line-to-ground faults is a function of both the
positive and the zero sequence impedances. This important loop impedance
is ZS = (2Z1 +Z0)/3. The sequence impedances, Z1 and Z0, used in the fault
calculations include the sum of the impedances with both resistance and
reactance along the fault current path. Some of the common branch imped-
ances are given below including some rule-of-thumb values that are useful
for hand calculations:
•
Overhead lines:
•
|Z1| = 0.5 W/mi (0.3 W/km)
•
|ZS| = 1 W/mi (0.6 W/km)

•
Substation transformer:
•

•
A typical 15-kV substation transformer impedance is 1 W, which
corresponds to a bus fault current of 7.2 kA for a 12.47-kV circuit.
•
Subtransmission equivalent: often can be ignored
See Smith (1980) for an excellent paper on fault calculations for additional
information. Include impedances for step-down transformer banks, series
reactors, and voltage regulators. Use the rule-of-thumb numbers above for
back-of-the-envelope calculations and as checks for computer modeling.
The simpliﬁed equation for a transformer impedance is
where
kV = line-to-line voltage
MVA = transformer base rating — open air (OA) rating
Z% = transformer impedance, per unit
We ignore the resistive component since the X/R ratio of station transform-
ers is generally greater than 10 and often in the range of 20 to 30. The
transmission/subtransmission equivalent is usually small, and we often

ignore it (especially for calculating maximum fault currents). Include the
transmission system impedance for weak subtransmission systems such as
34.5-, 46- or 69-kV circuits, or for very large substations. Find the transmis-
sion equivalent from the per unit impedances (r1, x1, r0, and x0) on a given
MVA base referred to the distribution voltage (Smith, 1980) as
where
MVAb = base MVA at which the r and x impedances are given
kVs = line-to-line voltage in kV on the secondary side of the station 
transformer
kVp = line-to-line voltage in kV on the primary
kVpb = base line-to-line voltage on the primary used to calculate MVAb
(often equal to kVp)
If the transmission impedances are available as a fault MVA with a power
factor, ﬁnd the transmission equivalent (Smith, 1980) with
where
MVA = 3-phase short-circuit MVA at the primary terminals of the station 
transformer (see Table 7.2 for typical maximum values)
kIg = available ground fault current in kA at the primary terminals of the 
station transformer
pf = power factor in per unit for the available three-phase fault current
pfg = power factor in per unit for the available single-phase fault current
While almost all distribution circuits are radial, there may be other fault
current sources. We ignore these other sources most of the time, but occa-
sionally, we consider motors and generators in fault calculations. Synchro-
nous motors and generators contribute large currents relative to their size.

of connected synchronous units are needed to signiﬁcantly affect fault cur-
rents. On weaker circuits, smaller units can impact fault currents. Induction
motors and generators also feed faults. Inverter-based distributed generation
can contribute fault current, but generally much less than synchronous or
induction units. Of course, on feeders that have network load, current
through network transformers backfeeds faults until the network protectors
operate.
7.2.1
Transformer Connections
The fault current on each side of a three-phase transformer connection can
differ in magnitude and phasing. In the common case of a delta – grounded-
wye connection, the current on the source side of the transformer differs
from the currents on the fault side for line-to-ground or line-to-line faults
(see Figure 7.9). For a line-to-ground fault on the primary side of the trans-
former, the current appears on two phases on the primary with a per unit
current of 0.577 (which is 
).
These differences are often needed when coordinating a primary-side pro-
tective device and a secondary-side device. In distribution substations, this
is commonly a fuse on the primary side and a relay controlling a circuit
breaker on the secondary side. The line-to-line fault must be considered —
this gives more per-unit current on one phase in the primary, 1.15 per unit

) in one of the phases (see Figure 7.9). To make sure a primary fuse
coordinates with a secondary device, shift the minimum-melting time-cur-
rent curve of the primary-side fuse to the left by a factor of 0.866 = 
(after also adjusting for the transformer turns ratio). The current differences
also mean that the transformer is not protected as well for single-phase faults;
a primary-side fuse takes longer to clear the single-phase fault since it sees
less current than for a three-phase or line-to-line fault.
Fault currents are only different for unbalanced secondary currents. For a
three-phase secondary fault, the per-unit currents on the primary equal those
on the secondary (with the actual currents related by the turns ratio of the
transformer). A wye – wye transformer does not disturb the current rela-
tionships; the per-unit currents on both sides of the transformer are equal.
In a ﬂoating wye – delta, similar current relationships exist; a line-to-line
secondary fault shows up on the primary side on all three phases, one of
which is 1.15 per unit (see Figure 7.10). For a ﬂoating wye – delta transformer
with a larger center-tapped lighting leg and two power legs, fault current
calculations are difﬁcult. Faults can occur from phase to phase and from
phase to the secondary neutral, and the lighting transformer will have a
different impedance than the power leg transformers. For an approach to
modeling this, see Kersting and Phillips (1996).
7.2.2
Fault Proﬁles
Fault proﬁles show fault current with distance along a circuit. Determining
where thermal or mechanical short-circuit limits on equipment may be
exceeded, helping select or check interrupting capabilities of protective
equipment, and coordinating protective devices are important uses of fault
proﬁles. Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12 show typical fault current proﬁles of
distribution circuits.
Some general trends that the fault proﬁles show are:
•
Distance — The fault current drops off as the inverse of distance (1/d).
•
Ground faults — On overhead circuits, the ground fault current
falls off faster (and the ground fault current is generally lower)

than the three-phase fault current. The zero-sequence reactance is
generally over three times the positive-sequence reactance, and the
zero-sequence resistance is also higher than the positive-sequence
resistance.
•
System voltage — On higher-voltage distribution systems, the fault
current drops off more slowly. The actual line impedance does not
change with voltage (ZS ª1 W/mi), and since I = VLN/Z, it takes more
impedance (more circuit length) to reduce the fault current.
•
Cables — Underground cables have much lower reactance than over-
head circuits, so the fault current does not fall off as fast on under-
ground circuits. Also, note that X/R ratios are lower on cables.
•
Proﬁles — The three-phase and ground-fault proﬁles of underground
cables are similar. The zero-sequence reactance can actually be
smaller than the positive-sequence reactance (but the zero-sequence
resistance is larger than the positive-sequence resistance).
7.2.3
Effect of X/R Ratio
In a reactive circuit (high X/R ratio), it is naturally more difﬁcult for a
protective device such as a circuit breaker to clear a fault. Protective devices
clear a fault at a current zero. Within the interruptor, dielectric strength builds
up to prevent the arc from reigniting after the current zero. In a resistive
circuit (low X/R ratio), the voltage and current are in phase, so after a current
zero, a quarter cycle passes before the voltage across the protective device
(called the recovery voltage) reaches its peak. In a reactive circuit, the fault
current naturally lags the voltage by 90∞; the voltage peaks at a current
zero. Therefore, the recovery voltage across the protective device rises to its
peak in much less than a quarter cycle (possibly in 1/20th of a cycle or less),
and the fault arc is much more likely to reignite.
Another factor that makes it more difﬁcult for protective devices to clear
faults is asymmetry. Circuits with inductance resist a change in current. A
short circuit creates a signiﬁcant change in current, possibly creating an
offset. If the fault occurs when the current would naturally be at its negative
peak, the current starts at that point on the waveshape but is offset by 1.0
per unit. The dc offset decays, depending on the X/R ratio. The offset is
described by the following equation:

Asymmetry is higher with higher X/R ratios. The worst case offset with
X/R = • is 2 per unit. Figure 7.13 shows an example of an offset fault current.
If a phase faults at the natural zero crossing (b = q), no offset occurs. The
highest magnitude of the dc component occurs when the fault happens 90o
from the natural zero crossing of the circuit (when b = q±p/2). The highest

dc offset does not align with the highest peak asymmetric current (which is
the sum of the ac and decaying dc component). The peak current occurs
when the closing angle b= 0 for all X/R ratios (b = 0 when the fault occurs
at a voltage zero crossing). The ratio of the peak current Ip to the rms current
Irms can be approximated by
This is the most industry-accepted approximation that is used, but it gives
an approximation that is slightly low. A more accurate approximation can
be found (St. Pierre, 2001) with
where t is a ﬁctitious time found with
In addition to causing a higher peak magnitude, asymmetry also causes
a longer ﬁrst half cycle (important for fuse operating time) and much higher
ﬁrst half cycle ÚI2 dt. The occurrence of asymmetry is reduced by the fact
that most faults occur when the voltage is near its peak (Figure 7.5). In a
circuit with a high X/R ratio, when the voltage is at its peak, the fault current
is naturally near zero. Therefore, for most faults, the asymmetry is small,
especially for line-to-ground faults. For two- or three-phase faults where
each phase is faulted simultaneously (as can happen with lightning), asym-
metry is much more likely.
Asymmetry is important to consider for application of cutouts, circuit
breakers, and other equipment with fault current ratings. Equipment is gen-
erally tested at a given X/R ratio. If the equipment is applied at a location
where the X/R ratio is higher, then the equipment may have less capability
than the rating indicates. Equipment often has a momentary duty rating
which is the short-time (ﬁrst-cycle) withstand capability. This is strongly
inﬂuenced by asymmetry.
Other impacts of asymmetry include:
•
Asymmetry can saturate current transformers (CTs). On distribution
circuits, overcurrent relays should still operate although they could
be more susceptible to miscoordination.
•
Fuses respond to ÚI2dt, so asymmetrical current melts the link sig-
niﬁcantly faster.

Secondary Faults
Secondary faults vary depending on the transformer connection and the type
of fault on the secondary. For a standard single-phase 120/240-V secondary
for residential service, two faults are of interest: a fault from a phase to the
neutral and a fault from one of the hot legs to the other across the full 240
V. The impedance to the fault includes the transformer plus the secondary
impedance. The secondary current for a bolted fault across the 240-V legs
(between the two hot legs) is

phase)

For a short circuit from one of the hot legs to the neutral, both the trans-
former and the secondary have different impedances. For the transformer,
the half-winding impedance must be used; for the secondary, the loop
impedance through the phase and the neutral should be used.

I120 = Secondary current in symmetrical A rms for a 120-V fault (phase-to-
neutral)

In absence of better information, use the following impedances for trans-
formers with an interlaced secondary winding:
RT1 = 0.375RT
and
XT1 = 0.3XT
And use the following impedances for transformers with noninterlaced
secondary windings:
RT1 = 0.4375RT
and
XT1 = 0.625XT
Figure 7.14 shows fault proﬁles for secondary faults on various size trans-
formers. The secondary is triplex with 3/0 aluminum conductors and a
reduced neutral. It has impedances of
RS = 0.211 W/1000 ft
XS = 0.0589 W/1000 ft
RS1 = 0.273 W/1000 ft
XS1 = 0.0604 W/1000 ft
The secondary has signiﬁcant impedances; fault currents drop quickly
from the transformers. Close to the transformer, line-to-neutral faults are
higher magnitude. At large distances from the transformer, the secondary
impedances dominate the fault currents. Faults across 240 V are normally
higher magnitude than line-to-neutral faults.

Normally in secondary calculations, we can ignore the impedance offered
by the distribution primary. The primary-system impedance is usually small
relative to the transformer impedance, and neglecting it is conservative for
most uses. On weak distribution systems or with large, low-impedance
distribution transformers, the distribution system impedance plays a
greater role.
7.2.5
Primary-to-Secondary Faults
Faults from the distribution primary to the secondary can subject end-use
equipment to signiﬁcant overvoltages. Figure 7.15 shows a circuit diagram
of a fault from the primary to a 120/240-V secondary. This type of fault can
occur several ways: a high-to-low fault within the transformer, a broken
primary wire falling into the secondary, or a broken primary jumper. As we
will discuss, the transformer helps limit the overvoltage. Having the primary
fall on the secondary does not automatically mean primary-scale voltages
in customers’ homes and facilities.

The per-unit secondary voltage for a fault from the primary to the second-
ary (PTI, 1999) is
where
Vs = secondary voltage, per unit at 120 V
n = transformer turns ratio from the primary voltage to the half-voltage 
secondary rating (normally 120 V)
IkA = available primary fault current for a single line-to-ground fault, kA

VkV = primary line-to-ground winding rated voltage, kV
Figure 7.16 shows the per-unit overvoltage for various transformer
sizes. Surprisingly, the primary voltage does not impact the overvoltage
signiﬁcantly. The overvoltage equation in per unit reduces (PTI, 1999) to
approximately
The overvoltage increases with higher available fault current, higher
impedance transformers, and smaller transformers. For all but the smallest
transformers with the highest impedance, the overvoltage is not too hazard-
ous. But, if a fuse operates to separate the transformer from the circuit but

leaves the primary-to-secondary fault, the fault imposes full primary voltage
on the secondary (at least until the ﬁrst failure on the secondary system).
Such a condition can occur when the fault starts on the primary side above
the transformer fuse (see Figure 7.17). If the transformer fuse blows before
the upstream line fuse, the secondary voltage rises to the primary voltage.
If the fault is below the transformer fuse, it does not matter which fuse blows
ﬁrst; either clears the fault.
The example in Figure 7.15 shows a fault to the secondary leg that is in
phase with the primary (off of the X1 bushing of the transformer). A fault
to the other secondary leg (off of X3) has very similar effects; the voltages
and currents are almost the same, so the equations and graphs in this section
also apply.
Although the transformer helps hold down the overvoltage, the primary-
to-secondary fault may initiate a sizeable switching transient that could
impact end-use equipment.
With most line fuses and transformer fuses used, the line fuse will clear
before the transformer fuse and before the transformer suffers damage (good
news on both counts). Even though the upstream fuse is larger, it sees (n – 1)

times the fault current. With the primary fault above the transformer fuse,
the transformer fuse is more likely to operate before the line fuse with
•
Small transformer fuses — Another reason not to fuse transformers
too tightly; smaller, fast transformer fuses are more likely to clear
before an upstream device.
•
Upstream breaker or recloser — If the upstream device is a circuit
breaker or recloser instead of a fuse, the tripping time is much longer,
especially on a time-delayed trip (but even a fast trip is relatively
long). If a circuit breaker is upstream of the transformer, the trans-
former fuse is likely to blow before the circuit breaker for locations
with high fault currents and with small transformer fuses.
A more detailed analysis of the coordination of the two devices requires
using the time-current characteristics of each of the protective devices along
with the currents. The current into the primary winding, Ip in kA is
Again, the upstream device sees (n – 1)Ip, which is almost the full available
current for a single line-to-ground fault, IkA.
A transformer with a secondary circuit breaker (as in a completely self-
protected transformer, a CSP) has another possible mode where the trans-
former separates. If the secondary circuit breaker opens before the upstream
primary device, the high-to-low fault raises the secondary voltage to the
primary voltage. The secondary circuit breaker may not be able to clear the

fault because the arc recovery voltage is much higher than the rating for the
secondary circuit breaker; this is good news in that it helps protect end-use
equipment from extreme overvoltages, but the secondary circuit breaker may
fail trying to clear the fault. If the upstream device is a fuse, the fuse will
probably clear before the secondary circuit breaker opens, but if the upstream
device is a circuit breaker, the secondary circuit breaker will probably try to
open ﬁrst.
7.2.6
Underbuilt Fault to a Transmission Circuit
Faults from transmission circuits to distribution circuits are another hazard
that can subject distribution equipment and customer equipment to
extremely high voltages. Consider the example in Figure 7.18 of a fault from
a subtransmission circuit to a distribution circuit.
As is the case for primary-to-secondary faults discussed in the previous
section, overvoltages are not extremely high as long as the distribution
circuit stays connected. But if a distribution interrupter opens the circuit,
the voltage on the faulted distribution conductor jumps to the full transmis-
sion-line voltage. With voltage at several times normal, something will fail
quickly. Such a severe overvoltage is also likely to damage end-use equip-
ment. The distribution interrupter, either a circuit breaker or recloser, may
not be able to clear the fault (the recovery voltage is many times normal);
it may fail trying.
Faults further from the distribution substation cause higher voltages, with
the highest voltage at the fault location. Current ﬂowing back towards the
circuit causes a voltage rise along the circuit.
While one can use a computer model for an exact analysis (but it is not
possible with most standard distribution short-circuit programs), a simpli-
ﬁed single-phase analysis (assuming a wye – wye transformer) helps frame
the problem. The fault current is approximately
FIGURE 7.18

where
n = ratio of the transmission to distribution voltage (n = 69/12.5 = 5.5 in 
the example)
VS = rms line-to-ground transmission source voltage (40 kV in the exam-
ple)
ZA = loop impedance from the transmission source to the high side of the 
distribution station
ZB = loop impedance from the high-side at the distribution station out to 
the fault and back to the distribution low-side of the distribution sub-
station
And, the 69-kV impedance often dominates, so the fault current is really
determined by ZA. For the distribution and transmission line impedances,
ZA and ZB, you can use 1 W/mi for quick approximations. The worst case is
with a small ZA, a stiff subtransmission system.
The voltage at the fault is
where
Vd =line-to-ground voltage on the distribution circuit at the substation (as 
a worst case, assume that it is the nominal voltage; it will usually be 
less because of the sag that pulls down the voltages).
Figure 7.19 shows results from a series of computer simulations on a 12.5-
kV circuit for various fault locations and subtransmission source stiffnesses.
Results only modestly differ for other conﬁgurations: a 69-kV source in the
opposite direction, a looped transmission source, a different substation trans-
former conﬁguration, or different phases faulted. The worst cases are for
stiff transmission systems.
If a distribution interrupter opens to leave transmission voltage on the
distribution circuit, distribution transformers would saturate and metal-
oxide arresters would move into heavy conduction. Transformer saturation
distorts the voltage but may not appreciably reduce the peak voltage. Arrest-
ers can reduce the peak voltage, but they could still allow quite high voltages
to customers. Arresters with an 8.4-kV maximum continuous operating volt-
age start conducting for power-frequency voltages at about 11 to 12 kV (1.5
to 1.6 times the nominal system line-to-ground voltage). At higher voltages,
the arresters will draw more current. Depending on the number of arresters,
a stiff transmission source can still push the voltage to between 3 and 4 per

unit, which is 20 to 30 kV (until an arrester or something else fails). In fact,
the best protection happens when the arrester fails as fast as possible; the
arrester becomes a sacriﬁcial protector. Normal-duty arresters fail faster than
heavy-duty arresters, which limits the duration of overvoltages. Goedde et
al. (2002) propose using gapped arresters; their lab tests found that gapped
arresters clip the overvoltage to a lower magnitude and fail faster during
overvoltages.
To reduce the hazard of underbuilt distribution lines, consider the follow-
ing experimental options:
•
Arresters — Use normal-duty arresters and possibly gapped arresters.
•
Fuses — Try to avoid using fuses or reclosers where it leaves signif-
icant downstream exposure underbuilt. The fast operation of fuses
and reclosers are more likely to clear the distribution circuit before
the overbuilt circuit.
•
Directional relays — In faults to a transmission circuit, the power
ﬂows from the fault into the distribution station transformer (the
opposite direction of power ﬂow for normal faults). Tripping the
distribution circuit breaker only for faults with forward power ﬂow
leaves the circuit breaker in for subtransmission faults.
•
Disable the instantaneous — Without the instantaneous trip on the
distribution feeder, the circuit breaker will wait longer before trip-
ping. The transmission circuit is more likely to trip ﬁrst.
•
Coordinate devices — Coordinate the transmission-line protection to
clear before the distribution circuit operates over the range of fault

currents that can occur. Include the effects of multiple reclose oper-
ations on the transmission circuit. Evaluate the substation recloser or
circuit breaker; and also, consider feeder protective devices (normally
reclosers). Try to speed up clearing times on the transmission circuit
as much as possible (both ends for looped subtransmission circuits).
•
Ground switch (very experimental) — Whenever the distribution circuit
breaker opens, engage a grounding switch on the load side of the
distribution circuit breaker. This grounds the fault, preventing over-
voltages and sustaining the fault on the transmission circuit.
•
Structures — As much as possible, design the common structure to
minimize the chance of faults between circuits. Use wide spacings
between the two circuits, and build the subtransmission circuit to
high mechanical standards to reduce the chance of broken conduc-
tors or crossarms or braces. More extreme protection could be pro-
vided by stringing a grounded conductor and placing it between the
subtransmission and the distribution circuits. If the ground is
involved in the fault, it will prevent overvoltages. These options are
obviously difﬁcult to retroﬁt, but these issues should be considered
when designing new circuits.
Thoroughly review such options before implementation. Normally, utili-
ties treat underbuilt circuits the same as any other circuit. These are exper-
imental approaches; I do not know of any implementation of these options
for circuits with overbuilt transmission. Also, most of these options do not
help as much for distribution lines fed from a different transmission source.
7.2.7
Fault Location Calculations
If we know the voltages and currents during a fault, we can use these to
estimate the distance to the fault. The equation is very simple, just Ohm’s
Law (see Figure 7.20):

where
V = voltage during the fault, V
I = current during the fault, A
Zl = line impedance, W/length unit
d = distance to the fault, length unit such as mi
With complex values entered for the voltages and impedances and currents,
the distance estimate should come out as a complex number. The real com-
ponent should be a realistic estimate of the distance to the fault; the imagi-
nary component should be close to zero. If not, then something is wrong.
While the idea is simple, a useful implementation is more difﬁcult. Differ-
ent fault types are possible (phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground, etc.), and each
type of fault sees a different impedance. Fault currents may have offsets.
The fault may add impedance. There are uncertainties in the impedances,
especially the ground return path. Conductor size changes also make loca-
tion more difﬁcult.
Many relays or power quality recorders or other instruments record fault
waveforms. Some relays have fault-locating algorithms built in.
The Ohm’s Law equation is actually overdetermined. We have more infor-
mation than we really need. The distance is a real quantity, but the voltages,
currents, and impedances are complex, so the real part of the result is the
distance, and the reactive part is zero. Most fault-locating algorithms use
this extra information, allow the fault resistance to vary, and ﬁnd the distance
that provides the optimal ﬁt (Girgis et al., 1993; Santoso et al., 2000). The
problem with this approach is that the fault resistance soaks up the error in
other parts of the data. It does not necessarily mean a better distance esti-
mation. Most fault arcs have a resistance that is very close to zero. In most
cases, we’re better off assuming zero fault resistance.
The most critical input to a fault location algorithm is the impedance data.
Be sure to use the impedances and voltages and currents appropriate for the
type of fault. For line-to-ground faults, use line-to-ground quantities; and
for others, use phase-to-phase quantities:
•
Line-to-ground fault

Remember that these are all complex quantities. It helps to have software
that automatically calculates complex phasors from a waveform. Several
methods are available to calculate the rms values from a waveform; a Fourier
transform is most common. Some currents have signiﬁcant offset that can
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

add error to the result. Try to ﬁnd the magnitudes and angles after the offset
has decayed (this is not possible on some faults cleared quickly by fuses).
If potential transformers are connected phase to phase, we can still estimate
locations for ground faults if we know the zero-sequence source impedance.
Schweitzer (1990) shows that the phase-to-ground voltage is
Va = 1/3(Vab – Vca) – Z0,srcI0
where
Z0,src = zero-sequence impedance of the source, W
I0 = zero-sequence current measured during the fault = Ia/3 for a single 
line-to-ground fault on phase A
Although the voltages and currents are complex, we can also estimate the
distance just using the absolute values. Although we lose some information
on how accurate our solution is because we lose the phase angle information,
in many cases it is as good as using the complex quantities. So, the simple
fault location solution with absolute values is
where
V = absolute value of the rms voltage during the fault, V
I = absolute value of the rms current during the fault, A
Zl = absolute value of the line impedance, W/length unit
d = distance to the fault, length unit such as mi
With this simple equation, we can estimate answers with voltage and current
magnitudes. For a ground fault, Zl=ZS is about 1 W/mi. If the line-to-ground
voltage, V=5000 V, and the fault current, I=1500 A, the fault is at about 3.3
mi (5000/1500). Remember to use the phase-to-phase voltage and |Ia – Ib|
(and not |Ia| – |Ib|) for faults involving more than one phase.
We can calculate the distance to the fault using only the magnitude of the
current (no phase angles needed and only prefault voltage needed) and the
line and source impedances involved. If we know the absolute value of the
fault current and the prefault voltage and the source impedance, the distance
to the fault is a solution to the quadratic equation

Ifault = absolute value of the rms current during the fault, A
Vprefault = absolute value of the rms voltage just prior to the fault, V
In this case, we are doing the same thing as taking a fault current proﬁle
(such as Figure 7.11) and interpolating the distance. In fact, it is often much
easier to use a fault current proﬁle developed from a computer output rather
than this messy set of equations. If the prefault voltage is missing, assume
that it is equal to the nominal voltage. If we have the prefault voltage, divide
the current by the per-unit prefault voltage before interpolating on the fault
current proﬁle. Using a fault current proﬁle also allows changes in line
impedances along the length of the line. Carolina Power & Light used this
approach, and Lampley (2002) reported that their locations were accurate to
within 0.5 mi 75% of the time; and in most of the remaining cases, the fault
was usually no more than 1 to 2 mi from the estimate.
We can also just use voltages. If we know the source impedance, we do
not need current. The distance calculation is another quadratic formula
solution, this time with

As with the fault current approach, rather than using this equation, we can
interpolate a voltage proﬁle graph to ﬁnd the distance to the fault (such as
those in Figure 10.6). Again, we are assuming that the arc impedance is zero.
Fault locations of line-to-line and three-phase faults are most accurate
because the ground path is not included. The ground return path has the
most uncertainties. The impedance of the ground return path depends on
the number of ground rods, the earth resistivity, and the presence of other
objects in the return path (cable TV, buried water pipes, etc.). The ground
return path is also nonuniform with length.
This type of fault location is useful for approximate locations. For perma-
nent faults, a location estimate helps shorten the lengths of circuit patrolled.
Distance estimates can also help ﬁnd those irksome recurring temporary
faults that cause repeated momentary interruptions. Fault locations are most
accurate when the fault is within 5 mi of the measurement; beyond that, the
voltage proﬁle and fault current proﬁles ﬂatten out considerably, which
increases error. Fault location is difﬁcult if a circuit has many branches. If a
fault is 2 mi from the source on phase B, but there are 12 separate circuits
that meet that criteria, the location information is not as useful. Fault location
is also difﬁcult on circuits with many wire-size changes; it works best on
circuits with uniform mainline impedances with relatively short taps. Imped-
ance-based location methods produce close but not pinpoint results. For
underground faults, we would like to know exactly where to dig, but these
methods do not have that accuracy.
7.3
Limiting Fault Currents
Limiting fault current has many beneﬁts, which improve the safety and
reliability of distribution systems:
•
Failures — Overhead line burndowns are less likely, cable thermal
failures are less likely, violent equipment failures are less likely.
•
Equipment ratings — We can use reclosers and circuit breakers with
less interrupting capability and switches and elbows with less
momentary and fault close ratings. Lower fault currents reduce the
need for current-limiting fuses and for power fuses and allow the
use of cutouts and under-oil fuses.
•
Shocks — Step and touch potentials are less severe during faults.
•
Conductor movement — Conductors move less during faults (this
provides more safety for workers in the vicinity of the line and makes
conductor slapping faults less likely).
•
Coordination — Fuse coordination is easier. Fuse saving is more likely
to work.
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

At most distribution substations, three-phase fault currents are limited to
less than 10 kA, with many sites achieving limits of 7 to 8 kA. The two main
ways that utilities manage fault currents are:
•
Transformer impedance — Specifying a higher-impedance substation
transformer limits the fault current. Normal transformer impedances
are around 8%, but utilities can specify impedances as high as 20%
to reduce fault currents.
•
Split substation bus — Most distribution substations have an open tie
between substation buses, mainly to reduce fault currents (by a
factor of two).
Line reactors and a neutral reactor on the substation transformer are two
more options used to limit fault currents, especially in large urban stations
where fault currents may exceed 40 kA.
There are drawbacks of increasing impedance to reduce fault currents.
Higher impedance reduces the stiffness of the system: voltage sags are worse,
voltage ﬂicker is worse, harmonics are worse, voltage regulation is more
difﬁcult.
Areactor in the substation transformer neutral limits ground fault currents.
Even though the neutral reactor provides no help for phase-to-phase or three-
phase faults, it provides many of the beneﬁts of other methods of fault
reduction. Neutral reactors cost much less than line reactors. Ground faults
are the most common fault; and for many types of single-phase equipment,
the phase-to-ground fault is the only possible failure mode. A neutral reactor
does not cause losses or degrade voltage regulation to the degree of phase
reactors. On the downside, a neutral reactor has a cost and uses substation
space, and a neutral reactor reduces the effectiveness of the grounding sys-
tem (see Chapter 13).
Several advanced fault-current limiting devices have been designed (EPRI
EL-6903, 1990). Most use some sort of nonlinear elements — arresters, satu-
rating reactors, superconducting elements, or power electronics such as a
gate-turn-off thyristor — to limit the fault current either through the physics
of the device or through computer control. Since most distribution systems
have managed fault currents sufﬁciently well, these devices have not found
a market. Given that, the EPRI study surveyed utilities and found evidence
that a market for fault-current limiters exists if a device had low enough cost
and was robust enough.
7.4
Arc Characteristics
Many distribution faults involve arcs through the air, either directly through
the air or across the surface of hardware. Although a relatively good con-
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

ductor, the arc is a very hot, explosive ﬁreball that can cause further damage
at the fault location (including ﬁres, wire burndowns, and equipment dam-
age). This section discusses some of the physical properties of arcs, along
with the ways in which arcs can cause damage.
Normally, the air is a relatively good insulator, but when heavily ionized,
the air becomes a low-resistance conductor. An arc stream in the air consists
of highly ionized gas particles. The arc ionization is due to thermal ionization
caused by collisions from the random velocities of particles (between elec-
trons, photons, atoms, or molecules). Thermal ionization increases with
increasing temperature and with increasing pressure. The heat produced
by the current ﬂow (I2R) maintains the ionization. The arc stream has very
low resistance because there is an abundance of free, charged particles, so
current ﬂow can be maintained with little electric ﬁeld. Another type of
ionization caused by acceleration of electrons from the electric ﬁeld may
initially start the ionization during the electric-ﬁeld breakdown, but once
the arc is created, electric-ﬁeld ionization plays a less signiﬁcant role than
thermal ionization.
One of the characteristics that is useful for estimating arc-related phenom-
enon is the arc voltage. The voltage across an arc remains constant over a
wide range of currents and arc lengths, so the arc resistance decreases as the
current increases. The voltage across an arc ranges between 25 and 40 V/in
(10 to 16 V/cm) over the current range of 100 A to 80 kA (Goda et al., 2000;
Strom, 1946). The arc voltage is somewhat chaotic and varies as the arc length
changes. More variation exists at lower currents. As an illustration of the
energy in an arc, consider a 3-in. (7.6-cm) arc that has a voltage of about 100
V. If the fault current is 10 kA, the power in the arc is P = V · I = 100 V .10
kA = 1 MW. Yes, 1 MW! Arcs are explosive and as hot as the surface of the sun.
An upper bound of roughly 10,000 to 20,000 K on the temperature of the
arc maintains the relatively constant arc voltage per unit length. For larger
currents, the arc responds by increasing the volume of gas ionized (the arc
expands rather than increasing the arc-stream temperature). Higher currents
increase the cross-sectional area of the arc, which reduces the resistance of
the arc column; the current density is the same, but the area is larger. So, the
voltage drop along the arc stream remains roughly constant. The arc voltage
depends on the type of gas and the pressure. One of the reasons an arc
voltage under oil has a higher voltage gradient than an arc in air is because
the ionizing gas is mainly hydrogen, which has a high heat conductivity. A
high heat conductivity causes the arc to restrict and creates a higher-density
current ﬂow (and more resistance). The arc voltage gradient is also a function
of pressure. For arcs in nitrogen (the main ionizing gas of arcs in air), the
arc voltage increases with pressure as V µ Pk, where k is approximately 0.3
(Cobine, 1941).
Another parameter of interest is the arc resistance. A 3-ft (1-m) arc has a
voltage of about 1400 V. If the fault current at that point in the line was 1000
A, then the arc resistance is about 1.4 W. A 1-ft (0.3-m) arc with the same
fault current has a resistance of 0.47 W. Most fault arcs have resistances of 0
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

to 2 W. Figure 7.21 shows that the impact of an arc on the fault currents along
the line is fairly minor.
An arc voltage waveform has distinguishing characteristics. Figure 7.22
shows an arcing fault voltage that was initiated by tree contact on a 13-kV
circuit measured during the EPRI DPQ project. The voltage on the arc is in
phase with the fault current (it is primarily resistive). When the arc current
goes to zero, the arc will extinguish. The recovery voltage builds up quickly
because of the stored energy in the system inductance. Voltage builds to a
point where it causes arc reignition. The reason for the blip at the start of
the waveform (it is not a straight square wave) is that the arc cools off at the
current zero. Cooling lowers the ionization rate and increases the arc resis-
FIGURE 7.21
Ratio of fault current with and without an arc of the given length on a 12.47-kV circuit. This
assumes the same system parameters as the fault proﬁle in Figure 7.11 with the following
additional assumptions: the arc voltage gradient equals 40 V/in. (16 V/cm), the arc voltage is
all resistive, and the nonlinearity of the arc voltage is ignored.

tance. Once it heats up again, the voltage characteristic ﬂattens out. The
waveform is high in the odd harmonics and for many purposes can be
approximated as a square wave.
The movement and growth of an arc is primarily in the vertical direction.
Tests at IREQ in Quebec showed that the primary reason that the arc elon-
gates and moves vertically is the rising hot gases of the arc (Drouet and
Nadeau, 1979). The magnetic forces (J ¥ B) did not dominate the direction
or elongation. As a ﬁrst approximation over a range of currents between 1
and 20 kA, arc voltages up to 18 kV, and durations up to 0.5 sec, the arc
length can be expressed as a function of the duration only as
where
l = arc length, m
t = fault duration, sec
The arc movement is a consideration for underbuilt distribution and for
vertical construction. The equation above can be used as an approximation
to determine if an underbuilt distribution circuit could evolve and fault a
distribution or transmission circuit above. It also gives some idea of how
faults can evolve to more than one phase. Figure 7.23 shows an example of
a fault evolving from one to three phases over the course of about 1.5 sec
(the construction type is unknown, but it is probably a horizontal conﬁgu-
ration). Given the vertical movement of a fault current arc, vertical designs
are more prone to having faults evolve to more than one phase. We might

think that a fault evolving to include other phases is not a concern since the
three-phase circuit has to be opened anyway, whether it is a single- or three-
phase fault. But, the voltage sag during the fault is more severe if more than
one phase is involved, which is a good reason to use designs that do not
tend to propagate to more than one phase (and to use relaying or fusing that
operates quickly enough to prevent it from happening).
The temperature in the arc can be on the order of 10,000 K. This heat creates
hazards from burning and from the pressure wave developed during the
fault. The longer the arc, the more energy is created. NFPA provides guide-
lines on safe distances for workers based on arc blasts (NFPA 70E-2000).
Several groups have worked to determine the appropriate characteristics of
protective clothing (ASTM F1506-94, 1994). Because of the pressure wave,
consider hearing protection and fall protection for workers who could be
exposed to fault arcs. Arcs can cause ﬁres: pole ﬁres or ﬁres in oil-ﬁlled
equipment such transformers.
The pressure wave from an arc in an enclosed substation was the probable
cause of a collapse of a substation building (important since many distribu-
tion stations are required to be indoors because of environmental consider-
ations). Researchers found during tests that the pressure from a fault arc can
be approximated (Drouet and Nadeau, 1979) by

Although many electrical damage characteristics are a function of Ú I2 dt,
the pressure wave is primarily a function of ÚI dt (because the voltage along
the arc length is constant and relatively independent of the arc current).
Where arcs attach to wires, melting weakens wires and can lead to wire
burndown. Most tests have shown that the damage is proportional to ÚIk dt,
where k is near one but varies depending on the conductor type. For burn-
downs or other situations where the arc burns the conductor, the total length
of the arc is unimportant, the small portion of the arc near the attachment
point is important. The voltage drop near the attachment point is also very
constant and does not vary signiﬁcantly with current. The damage to con-
ductors is very much like that of an electrical arc cutting torch.
Burndowns are much more likely on covered wire (also called tree wire).
The covering restricts the movement of the attachment point of the arc to
the conductor. On bare wire, the arc will move because of the heating forces
on the arc and the magnetic forces (also called motoring).
On bare wire, burndowns are a consideration only on small conductors.
Tests (Lasseter, 1956) have shown that the main cause of failure on small
aluminum conductors is that the hot gases from the arc anneal the aluminum,
which reduces tensile strength. The testers found little evidence of arc burns
on the conductors. Failures can occur midspan or at a pole. Motoring is not
fast enough to protect the small wire.
Arcs can damage insulators following ﬂashover along the surface of the
insulators. This was the primary reason for the development of arcing horns
for transmission-line insulators. Arcing horns encourage a ﬂashover away
from the insulator rather than along the surface. Arcs can fail distribution
insulators. During fault tests across insulators by Florida Power & Light
(Lasseter, 1965), the top of the arc moved along the conductor. The point of
failure was at the bottom of the insulator where the arc moved up the pin
to the bottom edge of the porcelain. The bottom of the insulator gets very
hot and can fail from thermal shock. The threshold of chipping was about
360 C (C = coulombs = A-sec = ÚI dt), and the threshold of shattering was
about 1125 C (see Figure 7.24). Adding an aluminum or copper washer (but
not a steel washer) on top of the crossarm under the ﬂange of the grounded
steel pin reduced insulator shattering. The arc attaches to the washer rather
than moving up along the pin, increasing the threshold of chipping by a
factor of ﬁve. Composite insulators perform better for surface arcs than
porcelain insulators (Mazurek et al., 2000). Some composite insulators have
an external arc withstand test where I.t shall be 150 kA-cycles (2500 C for 60
Hz) (IEEE Std. 1024-1988).
Distribution voltages can sustain very long arcs, but self-clearing faults
can occur such as when a conductor breaks and falls to the ground (stretching
an arc as it falls). The maximum arc length is important because the longer
the arc, the more energy is in the arc. For circuits with fault currents on the
order of 1000 A and where the transient rise to the open-circuit voltage is
about 10 ms, about 50 V may be interrupted per centimeter of arc length
(Slepian, 1930). For a line-to-ground voltage of 7200 V, a line-to-ground arc
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

can reach a length of about 12 ft (3.7 m) before it clears. As another approx-
imation, the length that an arc can maintain in resistive circuits is [from (Rizk
and Nguyen, 1984) with some reformulation]:
where
l = arc length, in. (1 in. = 2.54 cm)
I = rms current in the previous half cycle, A
V = system rms voltage, kV (line to ground or line to line depending on 
fault type)
7.5
High-Impedance Faults
When a conductor comes in physical contact with the ground but does not
draw enough current to operate typical protective devices, you have a high-
impedance fault. In the most common scenario, an overhead wire breaks and
falls to the ground (a downed wire). If the phase wire misses the grounded
neutral or another ground as it falls, the circuit path is completed by the
high-impedance path provided by the contact surface and the earth.
The return path for a conductor lying on the ground can be a high imped-
ance. The resistance varies depending on the surface of the ground. Table

7.3 shows typical current values measured for conductors on different sur-
faces (for 15-kV class circuits).
The frequency of high-impedance faults is uncertain. Most utilities
responding to an IEEE survey reported that high-impedance faults made up
less than 2% of faults while a sizeable number (15% of those surveyed)
suggested that between 2 and 5% of distribution faults were not detectable
(IEEE Working Group on Distribution Protection, 1995). Even with small
numbers, high-impedance faults pose an important safety hazard.
On distribution circuits, high-impedance faults are still an unsolved prob-
lem. It is not for lack of effort; considerable research has been done to ﬁnd
ways to detect high-impedance faults, and progress has been made [see
(IEEE Tutorial Course 90EH0310-3-PWR, 1990) for a more in-depth sum-
mary]. Research has identiﬁed many characteristics of high-impedance faults
and have tested them for detection purposes. Efforts have been concentrated
on detection at the substation based on phase and ground currents. High-
impedance faults usually involve arcing, and arcing generally creates the
lower odd harmonics. Arcing faults may also contain signiﬁcant 2- to 10-
kHz components. Arcing also bursts in characteristic patterns. High-imped-
ance faults often cause characteristic changes in the load (for example, a
broken conductor will drop the load on that phase). None of these detection
methods is perfect, so some detection schemes use more than one method
to try to detect high-impedance faults.
We can also detect broken conductors at the ends of radial circuits. Loss
of voltage is the simplest method. Communication to an upstream protective
device or to a control center is required. A difﬁculty is that it takes many
devices to adequately cover a radial circuit (depending on how many
branches occur on the circuit). Also, the “ends” of circuits could change
during circuit reconﬁgurations or sectionalizing due to circuit interruptions.
Also, if the loss-of-voltage detector is downstream of a fuse, another detector

is needed at the fuse, so we can determine if the fuse operated or the
conductor broke.
Practices that help reduce high-impedance faults include
•
Tight construction framings — If a phase wire breaks, it is more likely
to contact a neutral as it falls. (A drawback is that utilities have
reported poorer reliability with tighter constructions like the armless
design.) A vertical construction is better than a horizontal construc-
tion. Single-phase structures are better than three-phase structures.
•
Stronger conductors — Larger conductors or ACSR instead of all-
aluminum conductor are stronger and less likely to break for a given
mechanical or arcing condition.
•
Smaller/faster fuses — Faster fuses are more likely to operate for high-
impedance faults. In addition, small fuses are likely to clear before
arcing damages wires, which could burn down the wires.
•
Tree trimming — Clearing trees and trimming reduces the number
of trees or branches breaking conductors.
•
Fewer reclose attempts — Each reclose attempt causes more damage
at the fault location.
•
Higher primary voltages — High-impedance faults are much less likely
at 34.5 kV and somewhat less likely at 24.94 kV than 15-kV class
voltages.
•
Public education — Public advertisements warning the public to stay
away from downed wires help reduce accidents when high-imped-
ance faults do occur.
Practices to avoid include:
•
Covered wire — Burndowns are more likely with covered wire. If a
covered wire does contact the ground, it is less likely to show visible
signs that it is energized such as arcing or jumping which would
help keep bystanders away.
•
Unfused taps — Burndowns are more likely with the smaller wire
used on lateral taps.
•
Midspan connectors — Flying taps can cause localized heating and
mechanical stress.
•
Rear-lot construction — Rear-lot construction is not as well main-
tained as road-side construction, so trees are more likely to break
wires. If wires do come down, it is more hazardous since they are
coming down in someone’s backyard.
•
Neutral on the crossarm — If a phase wire breaks, it is much less likely
to contact the neutral as it falls if the neutral is on the crossarm. Other
constructions that may have this same problem are overhead shield
wires and spacer cables that do not have an additional neutral below.

Three-wire distribution systems have some advantages and some disad-
vantages related to high-impedance faults. The main advantage of three-
wire systems is that there is no unbalanced load. A sensitive ground relay
can be used, which would detect many high-impedance faults. The sensitiv-
ity of the ground relay is limited by the line capacitance. The main disad-
vantage of three-wire systems is that there is no multigrounded neutral. If
a phase conductor breaks, there is a high probability that there will be a
high-impedance fault. If there is underbuilt secondary or phone or cable TV
under the three-wire system, then a high-impedance fault is less likely
because a grounded conductor is below the phases.
Spacer cable has some mechanical strength advantages that could help
keep phase wires in the air, and it has fewer faults due to trees. A downside
is the covering which makes burndowns more likely. Also, it has a messenger
wire that may act as the neutral; if it does not also have an underbuilt neutral,
a phase conductor is more likely to fall unimpeded.
Backfeeds from three-phase transformer and capacitor installations can
cause dangerous situations. If a wire breaks near a pole, at least half of the
time, the load side (downstream side) will lie on the ground. Backfeed to
the downed wire can occur through three-phase transformers downstream
of the fault. The backfeed can provide enough voltage and current to the
downed wire to be dangerous (but there will not be enough current to trip
protective devices). Note that a grounded-wye – grounded-wye connection
does not eliminate backfeeds. Another backfeed scenario is shown in Figure
7.25 where a three-phase load is fed from a fused tap. A bolted, low-imped-
ance fault on one phase will blow the fuse, but backfeed current may ﬂow
through the three-phase connection. Even with a low-impedance fault, the
backfeed current can be low enough that neither the remaining tap fuses nor
the transformer fuses will operate. The fault can continue to arc until the
wire burns down. An ungrounded capacitor bank can also provide a back-
feed path.
Commercial relays that have high-impedance fault detection capabilities
are available. One of the main problems with detection of high-impedance
faults is false fault detections. If a detection system in the station detects a
fault and a whole feeder is tripped for an event that is not really a high-
impedance fault, reliability is severely hurt. Before reenergizing, crews patrol
the circuit and make sure there was not a downed conductor. The sensitivity
of a device must be traded off against its dependability. If it is too sensitive,
many false operations will result. An alternative to tripping is alarming.
Operators in control centers may always trip a circuit if it signals a high-
impedance fault for fear of discipline if it really was a high-impedance fault
and an accident occurred. Each time a high-impedance fault is detected,
crews would have to patrol the circuit. If operators have too many false
alarms, they may ignore the alarm.
A tree branch in contact with a phase conductor also forms a high-imped-
ance fault. This is not as dangerous as a downed wire. Most of the time the
circuit operates normally, without danger to the public (but see Chapter 13
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

for more analysis of this situation). A tree branch in contact with a phase
conductor can draw enough current to trip a high-impedance fault detector.
In a heavily treed area, crews could require many hours to ﬁnd the location
where the tree contact is taking place.
One of the main problems with substation detection is that each feeder
usually covers many miles of line. With most faults, lateral fuses provide
an effective way to isolate and identify the location of faults within a rela-
tively small area. While it would be nice to have high-impedance fault
detection capability on lateral taps, the costs have been prohibitive. Contrast
a station detection scheme (one device) with detectors at taps — tens or
hundreds of devices.
Another solution to falling conductors is using guards installed on poles
below the phase wires to “catch” phase conductors. The guards are con-
nected to the grounded neutral, so when a phase conductor breaks, a low-
impedance fault is created. This would be a signiﬁcant expense to install
system-wide, but it may be suitable for isolated locations where it is critical
not to have energized downed conductors (a stretch that runs across a school
playground or a span that crosses a major road).

External Fault Causes
7.6.1
Trees
For many utilities, trees cause more faults and more interruptions than any
other factor. Tree trimming is expensive — the largest maintenance item for
most distribution companies. Tree trimming is also a contentious issue with

the public. Residents hate to have their 100-year-old maple trees touched (or
even their 30-year-old cottonwoods).
Faults caused by trees generally occur from three conditions:
1. Falling trees knock down poles or break pole hardware.
2. Tree branches blown by the wind push conductors together.
3. A branch falls across the wires and forms a bridge from conductor
to conductor (or natural tree growth causes a bridge).
Tree-caused faults can be temporary or permanent. Falling trees or
branches can cause permanent faults. Either falling across wires or pushing
them together, tree branches can cause temporary faults. Broken tree
branches account for the majority of interruptions. In one utility in the
northeast U.S., 63% were caused by broken branches compared to 11% from
falling trees and only 2% from tree growth (Simpson, 1997). Niagara Mohawk
Corporation (NIMO) found that 86% of permanent tree-faults were outside
of the right-of-way, and most were from major breakage (see Figure 7.26).
Falling trees do the most damage; they often break conductors and even
poles in some cases. Tree faults usually occur during storms, primarily from
wind. Snow and ice additionally contribute to tree failures.
Several companies have done tests to evaluate the electrical properties of
tree branches and how they cause faults (Goodfellow, 2000; Williams, 1999).
For a tree branch to cause a fault, the branch must bridge the gap between
two conductors, which usually must be sustained for more than 1 min. A
tree touching just one conductor will not fault. The tree branch must cause
a connection between two bare conductors (it can be phase to phase or phase
to neutral). A tree branch into one phase conductor normally draws less than
one amp of current under most conditions; this may burn some leaves, but
it will not fault. On small wires in contact with a tree, the arcing to the tree
may be enough to burn the wire down under the right conditions. While the
tree in contact with one wire will not fault the circuit, there are some safety
issues with trees in contact with overhead conductors (see Chapter 13).

A fault across a tree branch between two conductors takes some time to
develop. If a branch falls across two conductors, arcing occurs at each end
where the wire is in contact with the branch. At this point in the process,
the current is small (the tree branch has a relatively high impedance). The
arcing burns the branch and creates carbon by oxidizing organic compounds.
The carbon provides a good conducting path. Arcing then occurs from the
carbon to the unburned portion of the branch. A carbon track develops at
each end and moves inward.
Once the carbon path is established completely across the branch, the fault
is a low-impedance path. Now the current is high; it is effectively a bolted
fault. It is also a permanent fault. If a circuit breaker or recloser is opened
and then reclosed, the low-impedance carbon path will still be there unless
the branch burns enough to fall off of the wires.
Some other notable electrical effects include the following:
•
It makes little difference if the branch is wet or dry. Live branches
are more likely to fault for a given voltage gradient, but dead
branches are more likely to break.
•
Little branches can burn through and fall off before the full carbon
track develops, so minor leaf and branch burning does not cause faults.
•
The likelihood of a fault depends on the voltage gradient along the
branch (see Figure 7.27).
•
The time it takes for a fault to occur also depends on the voltage
gradient (see Figure 7.28).
•
Lower voltage circuits are much more immune to ﬂashovers from
branches across conductors. A 4.8-kV circuit on a 10-ft crossarm has

about a phase-to-phase voltage gradient of 1 kV/ft, very unlikely to
fault from tree contact. A 12.47-kV circuit has a 2.7 kV/ft gradient,
which is more likely to fault.
•
Candlestick or armless designs are more likely to ﬂashover because
of tighter conductor-to-conductor spacings.
These effects reveal some key issues:
•
Trimming around the conductors in areas with a heavy canopy does
not prevent tree faults. Traditionally, crews trim a “hole” around the
conductors with about a 10-ft (3-m) radius. If there is a heavy canopy
of trees above the conductors, this trimming strategy performs
poorly since most faults are caused by branches falling from above.
•
Vertical construction may help since the likelihood of a phase-to-
phase contact by falling branches is reduced.
•
Three-phase construction is more at risk than single-phase construction.
Tree trimming is expensive. An EPRI survey found that utilities spend an
average of about $10 per customer each year on tree trimming (EPRI TR-
109178, 1998). Trimming can also irritate communities. It is always a dilemma
that people do not want their trees trimmed, but they also do not want
interruptions. Consider the following general tree-trimming guidelines:
•
Removal — This is the most effective fault-prevention strategy, and
many homeowners are willing to have trees removed.

•
Danger trees — Trimming/removal is most effective if trees and
branches that are likely to fail are removed or trimmed to safe
distances. This does take some expertise by tree trimming crews.
•
Target — As with any fault-reduction program, efforts are best spent
on the poorest performing circuits that affect the most customers.
Along the same thought, spend more on three-phase mains than on
single-phase taps.
Targeting danger trees is especially beneﬁcial but requires expertise. In a
careful examination of several cases where broken branches or trees dam-
aged the system, 64% of the trees were living (Finch, 2001). Finch also advises
examining trees from the backside, inside the tree line (defects on that side
are more likely to fail the tree into the line). Finch describes several defects
that help signal danger trees (see Figure 7.29). Dead trees or large splits are
easy to spot. Cankers (a fungal disease) or codominant stems (two stems,
neither of which dominates, each stem at a branching point is approximately
the same size) require more training and experience to detect. It also helps
to know the types of trees that are prone to interruptions (this varies by area
and types of trees). For Niagara Mohawk, black locusts and aspens are
particularly troublesome; large, old roadside maples also caused more than
their share of damage (see Table 7.4).
Acceptable tree trimming (that is also still effective) is a public relations
battle. Some strategies that help along these lines include:
•
Talking to residents prior to/during tree trimming.
•
Trimming trees during the winter (or tree-trimming done “under
the radar”) — The community will not notice tree trimming as much
when the leaves are not on the trees.

•
Trimming trees during storm cleanups. Right after outages, residents
are more willing to accept their beloved trees being hacked up (this
is a form of the often practiced “storm-induced maintenance”; ﬁx it
when it falls down).
•
Cleaning up after trees are trimmed/removed.
•
Offering free ﬁrewood.
Choosing a tree-trimming cycle is tricky. Many utilities use a three- to ﬁve-
year cycle. Longer tree-trimming cycles lead to higher fault rates (see Figure
7.30). The optimal trimming cycle depends on

In heavily treed areas, covered conductors help reduce tree faults. This
“tree wire” provides extra insulation that reduces the chance of ﬂashover
for a branch between conductors. Good fault data is hard to ﬁnd comparing
fault rates of bare wire with covered wire. One utility whose results are
provided in Table 7.5 has shown reductions in interruption rates of greater
than 50% for covered wire and even more for spacer cable (the only caveat
here is the data is published by a manufacturer, so it may not be unbiased).
Tree and animal faults were also reduced by over 50%. European experience
with covered conductors suggests that covered-wire fault rates are about
75% less than bare-wire fault rates. In Finland, fault rates on bare lines are
about 3 per 100 km/year on bare and 1 per 100 km/year on covered wire
(Hart, 1994). Covered wire helps with animal faults as well as tree faults.
Spacer cable and aerial cables are also alternatives that perform well in
treed areas. Spacer cables are a bundled conﬁguration using a messenger
wire holding up three-phase wires that use covered wire. Aerial cables have
fully-rated insulation just like underground cables. In South America, both
covered wire and a form of aerial cable have been successfully used in treed
areas (Bernis and de Minas Gerais, 2001). The Brazilian company CEMIG
found that spacer cable faults were lower than bare-wire circuits by a 10 to
1 ratio (although the article did not specify if this included both temporary
and permanent faults). The aerial cable faults were lower than bare wire by
a 20 to 1 ratio. The effect on interruption durations is shown in Table 7.6.
Several spacer cables or aerial cables can be constructed on a pole. Spacer
cables and aerial cables have some of the same burndown considerations as
covered wire. Spacer cable construction does have a reputation for being
hard to work with. Both spacer cable and aerial cable costs more than bare

wire. CEMIG estimated that the initial investment was returned by the
reduction in tree trimming. They did minimal trimming around aerial cable
(an estimated factor of 12 reduction in maintenance costs) and only minor
trimming around spacer cable (an estimated factor of 6 reduction in main-
tenance costs).
7.6.2
Weather and Lightning
Many faults on overhead circuits are weather related: icing, wind, and light-
ning. The fault rate during severe storms increases dramatically. Much of
the physical and electrical stresses from these events are well beyond the
design capability of distribution circuits.
Overhead circuits are designed to NESC (IEEE C2-1997) mechanical stan-
dards and clearances, which prescribe the performance of the line itself to
the normal severe weather that the poles and wires and other structures
must withstand. Most storm failures are from external causes, usually wind
blowing tree limbs or whole trees into wires. These cause faults and can
bring down whole structures.
Lightning causes many faults on distribution circuits. While most are
temporary and do not do any damage, 5 to 10% of lightning faults perma-
nently damage equipment: transformers, arresters, cables, insulators. Distri-
bution circuits do not have any direct protection against lightning-caused
faults since distribution insulation cannot withstand lightning voltages. If
lightning hits a line, it causes a fault nearly 100% of the time. Since most
lightning-caused faults do not do any permanent damage, reclosing is used
to minimize the impact on customers. After the circuit ﬂashes over (and
there’s a fault), a recloser or reclosing circuit breaker will open and, after a
short delay, reclose the circuit.
It is important to properly protect equipment from lightning. Transformers
and cables are almost always protected with surge arresters. This prevents
most permanent faults caused by lightning. Equipment protection, arresters,
and lightning protection are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.

7.6.3
Animals
Faults caused by animals are often the number two cause of outages for
utilities (after trees). Squirrels cause the most faults. Squirrels thrive in sub-
urbs and love trees; utilities have noted increases in squirrel faults following
development of wooded areas. Squirrels are usually active in the morning
and sleep at night. Squirrel faults usually occur in fair weather. The patterns
of animal-caused faults have been used to classify “unknown” faults (Mo
and Taylor, 1995).
The two main ways to protect equipment against animals (particularly
squirrels) are:
•
Bushing protectors
•
Covered lead wires
Both of these were rated “very good” at reducing animal-caused interrup-
tions in an EPRI survey (EPRI TE-114915, 1999). Several survey respondents
noted that the bushing protectors were susceptible to deterioration and
tracking (they rated only “good” for durability). Some of the other comments
regarding bushing protectors include:
•
Insects nest in the bushing coverings, and birds probing for insects
cause bird electrocutions and faults.
•
Bushing covers hide loose connections and insulator damage and
interfere with infrared inspections.
Bushing protectors and covered lead wires are inexpensive if installed with
equipment (but expensive to retroﬁt). For transformer bushing protectors,
have crews leave some room between the bottom of the bushing protector
and the tank, so water does not build up and leak down through the bushing.
Some additional items that also help include
•
Trimming trees — Squirrels get to utility equipment via trees (pole
climbing is less common). If trees are kept away from lines, utility
equipment is less attractive.
•
Good outage tracking — Many outages are repeated, so a good
outage tracking system can pinpoint hotspots to identify where to
target maintenance.
•
Identifying animal — If outages are tracked by animal, it is easier
to identify proper solutions.
•
Maintaining proper clearances
•
Avoiding metal crossarms
Animal faults vary by construction habits within a region. Some common
problem areas that can lead to frequent animal faults include
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

•
Transformer bushings — A very common animal fault is across a
transformer bushing. Insulating paints are available for transform-
ers, but it degrades quickly. Bushing guards and/or insulated lead
wires offer the best protection.
•
Arresters (especially polymer) — Another common animal fault is
across an arrester, especially a tank-mounted arrester. Polymer-
housed arresters have more problems than porcelain-housed arrest-
ers because they are much shorter. Use animal guards on tank-
mounted arresters (especially on polymer-housed arresters).
•
Cutouts — Cutouts are sometimes installed such that there is a low
clearance between a phase conductor and a grounded object.
Fusing can also change the impact of animal-caused faults for faults across
a distribution transformer bushing or a tank-mounted arrester. If the trans-
former is externally fused, only the customers on the transformer have an
outage. If the transformer is a CSP with an internal fuse, then the tap fuse
or upstream circuit breaker operates.
Birds rank second (behind squirrels) as far as the number of outages caused
by animals (EPRI TE-114915, 1999; Frazier and Bonham, 1996). Many of the
practices listed above can help with birds as well. Additionally, some bird-
speciﬁc practices include:
•
Get rid of nests.
•
Track as a separate category.
•
Remove nearby roosting areas.
The types of animals causing faults varies considerably by region, and
there is also signiﬁcant variation within a region. Animal faults also ebb and
ﬂow with animal populations. Animal population data can be used as one
way to determine if “unknown” faults are really being caused by certain
animals.
7.6.4
Other External Causes
Automobiles and poles do not always coexist nicely. It is difﬁcult for utilities
to prevent car accidents. Sometimes utilities can work with city engineers
and police to try to lower speed limits and manage trafﬁc better to avoid
bad spots. Reﬂectors on poles may help. Siting poles further from roads
also helps.
Balloons and other debris also cause many interruptions. Covered wire
helps. Ladders, cranes, and other tall equipment into primary lines cause
dangerous ground-level voltages as well as causing faults. Keep getting the
word out. Public awareness campaigns help.
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

7.7
Equipment Faults
Equipment failures — transformers, capacitors, splices, terminations, insu-
lators, connectors — cause faults. When equipment fails, it is almost always
as a short circuit and rarely as an open circuit.
Equipment failures on overhead circuits are usually a small percentage of
faults (see Figure 7.1). This is conﬁrmed by another study at Paciﬁc Gas &
Electric Co. shown in Table 7.7. These are shown as a percentage of perma-
nent faults. Since equipment faults are almost always permanent faults, the
overall percentage of equipment failures is a low percentage of all faults
(since most faults are temporary on overhead circuits). On underground
circuits, most faults are due to equipment failures.
Distribution transformers are the most common major device, so their
failure rate is important. Transformers generally fail at rates of about 0.5%
per year. The most common failure mode starts as a breakdown of the turn-
to-turn insulation.
Table 7.8 shows equipment failure rates recorded over a 5-year period at
PG&E. This data is generic service-time failure rates, which is an estimate
to the actual failure rate. Note that this is for California which has very little
lightning and mild weather; other areas may have higher equipment failures.
The rate of all permanent faults was 0.11 faults/mi/year for rural circuits
(0.071 faults/km/year) and 0.16 faults/mi/year for urban circuits (0.102
faults/km/year). The only component where there was a statistical differ-
ence between urban and rural at the 90% conﬁdence level was the difference
in failure rates of transformers (the sample size for the rest of the numbers
was too small to statistically determine a difference).
Another source for equipment failure rate data is the IEEE Gold Book
(IEEE Std. 493-1997) (Table 7.9). Note that the Gold Book is for industrial
facilities. Application and loading practices may be signiﬁcantly different
than typical utility applications. Still, they provide useful comparisons.

Faults in Equipment
Failures in equipment pose special hazards with important safety ramiﬁca-
tions. Transformers deserve extra attention because they are so common.
One utility has reported one violent distribution transformer failure for every
270 transformers containing an internal fault, and 20% of re-energizations
had internal faults, which is one violent failure every 1350 reenergizations
(CEA 149 D 491A, 1997). Cuk (2001) estimated that between 2 and 5% of
overhead transformers are re-fused every year (based on analyzing fuse
purchases; this number varies with fusing practices). This section discusses
failure mechanisms and the consequences of an internal failure.

Transformer insulation degrades over the life of the transformer. Heat
drives the degradation of transformer insulation (this is a generality that
applies to many other types of insulation as well). Overloading transformers
will reduce a transformer’s life. Most utilities will overload distribution
transformers as it is the best economic way to operate them.
Heat degrades paper insulation at a relatively known rate. ANSI standards
give guidelines on loss of life versus temperature. Heating can also cause
generation of gas bubbles (Kaufmann and McMillen, 1983). Gas can be created
by decomposition of the paper insulation. Prolonged overloading to 175% can
cause gas generation. Gas can also be created when heated oil has a pressure
drop; the most likely scenario is an overloaded transformer that is cooled
quickly (the effect is most signiﬁcant for overloads above 175%). Rainfall causes
the quickest cooling; a loss of load also cools the transformer. The bubbles
reduce the dielectric strength of the insulation system. Bubble generation starts
when the temperature is near 145∞C. Hotspot temperatures exceeding 200∞C
during overloading can reduce the insulation strength by a factor of two (Kauf-
mann, 1977). Once the transformer cools off and the bubbles disappear, the
insulation recovers most of its initial strength (minus the amount of paper
degraded). During overloading, failures can be caused by the power-frequency
voltage or a voltage surge (the straw that breaks the camel’s back).
Internal faults in equipment such as transformers and capacitors can cause
violent damage. Of most concern, explosive failures endanger workers and
the public. Figure 7.31 shows a thought-provoking picture of a failure of a
recloser. It illustrates how important safety is. Buy quality equipment! Use
effective fault protection! Knowing the characteristics of internal failures
helps prevent such accidents. We must properly fuse equipment. Fusing
should ensure that if equipment does fail internally, it is isolated from the
system before it ruptures or ejects any oil.

During the 1970s, considerable work was done to investigate the failure
mechanisms, withstand abilities of transformers, and ways to improve pro-
tection (Barkan et al., 1976; Goodman and Zupon, 1976; Mahieu, 1975). The
voltage along an arc remains relatively constant regardless of the fault cur-
rent magnitude when under oil just as it does in air. An arc voltage under
oil is roughly 215 to 255 V/in. (85 to 100 V/cm) (Goodman and Zupon, 1976;
Mahieu, 1975), which is higher than the voltage gradient of arcs in air. The
arc voltage is higher because oil cools the arc, which reduces the ionization.
Because the arc voltage is constant, the energy in the transformer is a func-
tion of ÚI dt.
During a fault under oil, an arc creates a shock wave in the oil that can
cause signiﬁcant dynamic pressures. Also, considerable gas is generated at
the rate of roughly 4.3 to 6.1 in.3/kW (70 to 100 cm3/kW) (Barkan et al., 1976;
Goodman and Zupon, 1976). An arc in oil is hot enough to vaporize oil and
ionize the gas. The gasses created by the arc include roughly 65 to 80%
hydrogen and 15 to 25% acetylene with ethylene, methane, and higher molec-
ular-weight gasses. The arc also produces considerable amounts of solids
and free carbon. The arc generates combustible gasses, but combustion is
uncommon because the oxygen level is generally low.
The pressure buildup and failure mode is fairly complicated and depends
on the location of the fault. A fault in the windings generally causes less
peak pressure on the top of the tank than a free-burning arc in oil even if
the energy input is the same. The initial force on the transformer is a large
downward force in the oil, but the top usually fails ﬁrst since that is where
the weakest structures are (although the downward force and resulting
rebound can cause the transformer to buck violently which may break the
supports). The transformer lid is the weakest structural portion, so with
excessive pressure, the lid will be the ﬁrst place to fail. Another common
failure is a bushing ejection. For a given arc energy, larger transformers have
less pressure buildup because a larger transformer has a larger air space [a
100-kVA transformer has 3.8 times the air volume as a 10-kVA transformer
(Barkan et al., 1976)]. Padmounted transformers withstand more pressure
buildup than overhead transformers (Benton, 1979). Padmounts have higher
volume, and the square shape allows the tank to bulge out, which relieves
some of the stress.
Many distribution transformers have pressure release valves. These are
not fast enough to appreciably reduce the pressure buildup during high-
current faults. The pressure release valves help for low-current faults due to
interwinding failures. Most failures of distribution transformers start as
interwinding faults, either from turn-to-turn or from layer-to-layer. Turn-to-
turn faults on the primary winding draw less than load current, so they will
not operate the primary fuse. Turn-to-turn faults on the secondary and layer-
to-layer faults on the primary draw higher current that may be high enough
to operate the primary fuse. Interwinding faults are low-current events
where the pressure builds slowly, so the pressure release valves can effec-
tively release the pressure for primary-winding faults although secondary
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

winding faults may increase pressure faster than the pressure-relief valve
can dissipate (Lunsford and Tobin, 1997). As an interwinding fault arcs and
causes damage and melts additional insulation, the fault current will
increase; usually current jumps sharply to the bolted fault condition (not a
slow escalation of current).
Overhead completely self protected transformers (CSPs) and padmounted
transformers with under-oil fuses have less withstand capability than con-
ventional transformers. The reason for this is that the under-oil fuse (called
a weak-link fuse) provides another arcing location. When the weak-link fuse
melts, an arc forms in place of the melted fuse element. This arc is in addition
to whatever arc may exist within the tank that caused the fault in the ﬁrst
place. The arc across the fuse location is generally going to be longer than
normal arcs that could occur inside a transformer. The length of an under-
oil weak-link fuse is 2 to 3 in. (5.1 to 7.6 cm) for a 15-kV class fuse. Higher-
voltage transformers have longer fuses — a 35-kV class fuse has a length of
about 5 in. (12.7 cm). Also, the voltage gradient along an arc in a fuse tube
under oil is greater than a “free” arc in oil [the fuse tube increases the pressure
of the arc, which increases the voltage drop (Barkan et al., 1976)].
Transformers with under-oil arresters have a special vulnerability (Hen-
ning et al., 1989). The under-oil arrester provides another possible failure
mode which can lead to very high energy in the transformer if the arrester
fails. If the arrester blocks fail, a relatively long arc results. A 10-kV duty-
cycle rated arrester has a total block length of about 4.5 in. (11.4 cm). With
such a long arc, the energy in the transformer will be very high. Industry
tests and ratings do not directly address this issue. To be conservative,
consider using a current-limiting fuse upstream of the transformer if the
line-to-ground fault current exceeds 1 or 2 kA if under-oil arresters are used.
Stand-alone arresters are another piece of equipment where failure is a
concern. If an arrester fails, a long internal arc may cause the arrester to
explode, sending pieces of the housing along with pieces of the metal oxide.
The move from porcelain-housed arresters to polymer-housed arresters was
motivated primarily by the fact that the polymer-housing is less dangerous
if the arrester fails. With a porcelain-housed arrester, the thermal shock from
the arc can shatter the housing and forcefully expel the “shrapnel.” Polymer-
housed arresters are safer because the fault arc splits the polymer housing,
which relieves the pressure buildup (although if the arc originates inside the
blocks, the pressure can expel bits of the metal oxide). Arresters have caused
accidents, and they got a bad name when metal-oxide arresters were ﬁrst
introduced because they occasionally failed upon installation.
Distribution arresters may specify a fault current withstand which is gov-
erned by IEEE standards (ANSI/IEEE C62.11-1987). To pass the test, an
arrester must withstand an internal failure of the given fault current and all
components of the arrester must be conﬁned within the enclosure. The dura-
tion of the test is a minimum of 0.1 sec (manufacturers often specify other
times as well) which is a typical circuit breaker clearing time when the instan-
taneous relay element operates. If the available fault current is higher than
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

the rated withstand, then current-limiting fuses should be considered. With
polymer-housed arresters, the fault-current withstand is usually sufﬁcient
with manufacturers specifying withstand values of 10 to 20 kA for 0.1 sec.
The failure of arresters (especially porcelain-housed arresters) is also a
consideration for fusing. If an arrester is downstream of a transformer fuse
and the arrester fails, the relatively small transformer fuse will blow. If an
arrester is upstream of the transformer fuse then a larger tap fuse or the
substation circuit breaker operates, which allows a much longer duration
fault current. Arresters have isolators that disconnect the arresters in case of
failure. Isolators do not clear fault current. After the fuse or circuit breaker
operates, the disconnect provides enough separation to allow the circuit to
reclose successfully. If the next upstream device is a circuit breaker and an
instantaneous element is not used, fault currents could be much longer than
the tested 0.1 sec, so consider adding a fuse upstream of the arrester on
porcelain-housed units.
7.9
Targeted Reduction of Faults
Since faults are the root cause of interruptions and voltage sags, obviously, if
faults are reduced, the incidence of interruptions and sags will be reduced
(power quality and reliability improve) (Mo and Taylor, 1993). This can be
done in several ways including
•
Tree trimming
•
Animal guards
•
Arrester protection
•
Tree wire (covered wire)
•
Aerial or underground cable
•
Identifying and replacing poorly performing hardware
•
Line patrols including infrared thermography
One way to improve the fault-rate performance is to track the location and
type of faults. It is relatively straightforward to track permanent faults since
the failed equipment is obvious. They can be classiﬁed by category to help
determine what types of maintenance need to be performed. The effort in
tracking faults is paid back by targeting maintenance efforts to the most
important sections.
Temporary faults are harder to pinpoint. If a circuit breaker or recloser
operates and successfully recloses, the utility may be unaware of it (unless
they get complaints of blinking clocks). A fuse may be blown by a temporary
fault (especially if fuse blowing is used). If a fuse blows, the area narrows
considerably. For areas with repeat fuse operations, careful patrols may
identify areas where repeated faults occur. Still, if a tap fuse operates but is
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

re-fused successfully, the cause may have been a squirrel across a bushing,
a tree branch that fell onto then burned off of a line, or wind pushing two
conductors together. It often takes a trained eye to determine the cause.
The most important sections are not necessarily the locations with the most
faults per mile. The number of customers on a circuit and the type of cus-
tomers on a circuit are important considerations. For example, a suburban
circuit with many high-tech commercial customers should warrant different
treatment from a rural circuit with fewer, mostly residential and agricultural
customers. How this is weighted depends on the utility’s philosophy.
On-site investigations can help reduce faults. Faults tend to repeat at the
same locations and follow patterns. For example, one particular type and
brand of connector may have a high failure rate. If these are identiﬁed,
replacement strategies can be implemented. Another example is animal
faults. One particular pole, which happens to be a good travel path for
squirrels, may have a transformer with no animal guards. The same location
may have repeated outages. These may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd if they cause
temporary faults.
Faults are not evenly distributed along lines. Faults are not inevitable. Not
all faults are “acts of God.” Most are from speciﬁc deﬁciencies at speciﬁc
structures. On overhead circuits, most faults result from inadequate clear-
ances, inadequate insulation, old equipment, or from trees or branches
extending into a line.
Consider faults as preventable, then go look for them. Crews can be trained
to spot pole structures where faults might be likely. During restoration, crews
can identify several common causes of faults including
•
Poor jumper clearances
•
Old equipment (such as expulsion arresters)
•
Bushings or cable terminations unprotected against animals
•
Poor clearances with polymer arresters
•
Damaged insulators
•
Damaged covered wire
•
Bad cutout placement
•
Danger trees/branches present
Crews can ﬁx problems identiﬁed during the outage restoration or target
them for future repair.
Implement training out in the ﬁeld for best results; show examples of fault
sources (Taylor, 1995). Walk the line and use binoculars; this is more effective
than “riding the line.” Some fault sources are not obvious and require looking
at a structure from different angles. Taylor provides another good piece of
advice: never assume that the lines are built according to speciﬁcations.
Characteristic fault patterns are different at different locations. Factors that
inﬂuence these differences include types of trees, weather conditions, con-
(C) 2004 by CRC Press LLC

struction practices, and types of equipment purchased. Know the local
trends; they can help identify ways to reduce faults.
The best way to reduce faults over time is to “institutionalize” fault-
reduction practices. After identifying the most common fault sources, imple-
ment programs to address these so performance improves continually. Start
with a good design that eliminates fault sources, especially at equipment
poles; use sufﬁcient electrical clearance. Separate grounded objects from
phase conductors as much as possible. Then employ procedures to ensure
that more fault-resistant designs are implemented. Train linemen and ﬁeld
engineers to do it right. If possible, implement programs to bring old con-
struction up to speciﬁcations; replace old arresters, increase poor clearances,
add covered jumper wires, add animal guards, and so on. An opportune
time to clean up poor construction is when crews are already doing work
on a structure. Perform quality audits during work and after work is done.
Give crews and ﬁeld engineers feedback.

with appropriate analysis software. Analysis can be a challenge, based on part 
by environmental factors that infl uence the data, so a technician with level I 
or II thermography certifi cation should be employed to perform this survey. 
These services can be outsourced. Thermographic fi nds are invaluable from a 
safety perspective and typically result in a cost recovery within 1 year.
Passive airborne ultrasonic: It is a low-cost tool for detecting pressure and 
vacuum leaks in piping, steam traps, pressure vessels, and valves;  mechanical 
systems bearings, lubrication, and mechanical rubbing; and electrical 
systems arching and corona. Ultrasonic devices are becoming increasingly 
popular by technicians performing lubrication tasks to determine appropri-
ate lubrication levels. Operators require little training or prior experience 
and scanners cost as little as $1000.
Lubrication oil analysis: It is often performed on large or critical machines to 
determine its mechanical wear, the condition of lubricant, if the lubricant has 
become contaminated, and the condition and appropriateness of the lubri-
cant additives. Lube oil packages include checking for visual condition and 
odor, viscosity, water content, acidity, alkalinity, and metallic and nonmetallic 
contamination. Precise procedures must be followed in obtaining clean, 
 representative samples; however, analysis is performed in a laboratory at 
reasonable costs ($10–$100 per test). A single failure detected could pay for 
the program for several years.
Electrical condition monitoring techniques: It should be applied to electrical 
distribution cabling, panels, and connections; switchgear and controllers; 
transformers; electric motors; and generators. It is estimated that 95% of 
all electrical problems are due to connections (loose, corroded, under-
sized, and over tightened), unbalanced load, inductive heating, spiral 
heating in multistrand wires, slip rings, commutators, and brush riggings. 
Condition monitoring detects abnormal temperature, voltage, current, 
resistance, complex impedance, insulation integrity, phase imbalance, 
mechanical binding, and the presence of arching. The most common 
 predictive tests are
Infrared thermography—To detect temperature differences and the 
• 
overheating of circuits (see Chapter 8 for more detail)

former oil formed by transformer age and stress (carbon monoxide 
[CO] and carbon dioxide [CO2] to detect overheating of windings; 
CO, CO2, and methane [CH4] to detect hot spots in insulation; hydro-
gen, ethane, ethylene, and methane (H2, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4) to 
detect overheating of oil and/or corona discharge; and acetylene 
(C2H2) to detect internal arching) (see Chapter 4 for more detail)

nal short (impedance > 0), open circuit (impedance > infi nity), and

(see Chapter 8 for more detail)
Surge testing—Go/no-go test of winding insulation
• 
Motor circuit analysis (MCA)—Measures motor circuit resistance, 
• 
capacitance, imbalance, and rotor infl uence (see Chapter 10 for 
details)
Motor current signature analysis (MCSA)—Provides signatures of 
• 
motor current variations (see Chapter 10 for details)
Electric motor phase voltage unbalances affect the phase current unbalances, 
cause motors to run hotter, and reduce the motor’s ability to produce torque. 
For every 10°F increase in operating temperature, it is estimated that the life of 
the equipment is reduced by half (H.W. Penrose, White Paper, Test methods for 
determining the impact of motor condition on motor effi ciency and reliability).
Some of these electrical tests require the circuits to be energized, and 
others not. Some tests require specifi c initial conditions, such as normal 
operating temperature. Whereas some high loads amplify problems, low 
load allows for their nondetection.
Electricians, technicians, and electrical engineers trained in electrical 
predictive techniques can perform the testing. A comprehensive testing 
program toolbox would include an infrared camera, ultrasonic detector, 
multimeter/voltohmmeter, clamp-on current transformer, an insulation 
and PF test set, battery impedance test set, MCSA test set, and MCA tester.
Proactive maintenance: It improves equipment condition and rate of  degrada-
tion through better design, installation procedures, failure analysis, workman-
ship, and scheduling. Its procedures and technologies are used during forensic 
evaluations to determine the cause of failure. Proactive maintenance uses feed-
back to ensure that changes from lessons learned and best practices are incor-
porated in future designs and procedures. It employs a life-cycle view of 
maintenance, ensures that nothing affecting maintenance is done in isola-
tion, and integrates maintenance support functions into maintenance plan-
ning. It uses RCFA and predictive technologies to maximize maintenance 
effectiveness. Common proactive techniques are:
RCM specifi cations: Specifi cations that incorporate RCM philosophy and 
techniques are prepared for new and rebuilt equipment. These  specifi cations 
include vibration, alignment, and balance standards; electrical testing  criteria; 

10 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
lube oil testing requirements; and commissioning and acceptance testing 
requirements. Operator and maintenance feedback and RCM analysis docu-
mentation provide designers with justifi cation for equipment upgrades and 
modernization. New and replacement units’ design should refl ect lessons 
learned and best practices for improvements on operability, maintainability, 
and reliability.
Failed part analysis: Involves visually inspecting failed parts to identify the 
root cause of the failure. It looks at forensic scoring, color, and pitting, par-
ticularly of bearings, which are generally the equipment’s weakest compo-
nents and achieve only 10%–20% of their design life.
RCFA: Maintenance technicians usually repair symptoms, although recur-
ring problems are symptomatic of more severe problems. The end result is 
high cost, questionable mission reliability, strained user goodwill, and safety 
hazards. RCFA seeks to fi nd the cause, not just the effect, quickly, effi ciently, 
and economically. Predictive maintenance techniques detect and correct prob-
lems before failure, but do not act on the root cause. RCFA provide the infor-
mation to eliminate the recurrence and instill the mentality of “fi x forever.”
FMEA: Similar to RCFA, but performed prior to failure. Its goal is to iden-
tify potential failures and failure modes to take action to prevent the failure, 
detect the failure earlier, and reduce the consequences of failure. For each 
affected equipment, it describes the function, identifi es failure modes and 
the effects of failure, the probability and  criticality of failure, and suggests 
a maintenance approach.
Reliability engineering: It involves the redesign, modifi cation, and replace-
ment of components with superior components, such as sealed bearings, 
upgraded metal, and lubricant additives.
Age exploration: Determines the optimal maintenance frequency. Starts 
with the manufacturer’s recommendations, then adjusts the frequency based 
on equipment histories and observations and condition assessments during 
PMs and “open and inspects.”
Recurrence control: A repetitive failure is the recurring inability of a system, 
subsystem, structure, or component to perform the required function. The 
process analyzes the repeated failure of the same component, repeated fail-
ure of various components of the same system, and the repeated failure of 
the same component of various systems. Historical maintenance and trend 
data would be monitored to determine if recurring component problems 
might be symptomatic of possible genetic problems and/or procedures of 
system aging, corrosion, wear, design, operations, the work environment, 
or maintenance application (or misapplication).
Program implementation: The planning of a maintenance program 
should include considerations for proper test equipment, tools, trained per-
sonnel to carry out the maintenance tasks, and time required to perform 
inspections, tests, and maintenance routines. Also, consideration should be

given to record-keeping systems that range from computerized maintenance 
management systems (CMMSs) to manual fi le systems. There are number of 
companies that offer computerized maintenance management programs as 
stand alone programs or they can be incorporated into the facility opera-
tional programs. The reader is encouraged to look into this programs since 
they are not fully covered in this book.
The following are the steps in implementing an effective maintenance 
program:
 
1. Determine the objectives and long-range goals of the maintenance 
program.
 
2. Survey and consolidate data on equipment breakdowns.
 
3. Determine equipment criticalities.
 
4. Determine the risk and the amount of risk that you are willing to 
tolerate.
 
5. Establish metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and 
trend performance.
 
6. Establish the best maintenance techniques within your resources to 
mitigate the risk. Determine the maintenance procedures and 
frequencies.
 
7. Schedule and implement the program, starting with the most critical 
systems and those with the fastest, most benefi cial paybacks fi rst.
 
8. Publicize successes; provide trends, metrics, and KPIs to top man-
agement to gain management support.
 
9. Repeat the cycle.
Maintenance analyst: The quality of the maintenance program is refl ective 
of the skill of the maintenance technicians, their workmanship, quality of 
the supporting documentation, procedures, and the technologies used.
A position for maintenance analyst should be included in an RCM pro-
gram. This person should be able to detect the equipment condition, must 
have the skill to analyze the condition, must be able to diagnose the machine 
or system operation and develop a course of action, and must take the action 
needed to prevent failure (or allow RTF). The analyst would be responsible 
for monitoring and analyzing data for the mechanical systems. He or she 
would receive all work orders, trouble calls, KPIs, and test results and would 
provide continuous oversight and analysis.
Plant databases: CMMSs, building management systems (BMSs), and energy 
management systems (EMSs) provide invaluable historical data to the mainte-
nance analyst. Historical data from these provide information on age–reliability 
relationships, data to trend and forecast impending failure, test results, perfor-
mance data, and feedback to improve performance and to document condition.
RCM involves specifying and scheduling EPM activities in accordance 
with the statistical failure rate and/or life expectancy of the equipment being 

12 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
maintained and its criticality and productivity, and continually updating 
EPM procedures and schedules to refl ect actual maintenance experience in 
the plant. RCM is the most cost-effective of the alternative approaches because 
it improves plant safety, reliability, and availability while reducing mainte-
nance costs by concentrating limited maintenance resources on items which 
are the most important and/or troublesome, and reducing or eliminating 
unnecessary maintenance on items which are of little signifi cance and/or 
highly reliable. A comprehensive RCM program also incorporates structured 
provisions for failure root cause investigation and correction and for perfor-
mance monitoring to predict failures. RCM is used extensively in the  military 
and is gaining acceptance among both nuclear utilities and manufacturing 
plant operators as its advantages are increasingly recognized.
1.3.1 Key Factors in EPM Optimization Decisions
The optimum EPM approach for any specifi c plant, system, and/or piece of 
equipment depends on a variety of factors, including the following:
Safety impact of equipment failure
• 
Productivity and profi tability impact of equipment failure (includ-
• 
ing costs of lost production as well as failed equipment repair or 
replacement)
Cost of PM
• 
Failure rate and/or anticipated life of equipment
• 
Predictability of failure (either from accumulated operating time or 
• 
cycles or from discernible clues to impending failure)
Likelihood of inducing equipment damage or system problems 
• 
during maintenance and testing
Technical sophistication of the plant maintenance staff
• 
Availability of equipment reliability data to support RCM
• 
1.3.2 General Criteria for an Effective EPM and Testing Program
Effective electrical equipment and subsystem PM and testing programs 
should satisfy the criteria listed below.
First and most fundamental, a structured EPM program should actually 
exist. That is, EPM should be performed as follows:
Under formal management control
• 
In accordance with defi ned practices and schedules
• 
By clearly designated persons
• 
Specifi cally:
Management should assign a high priority to EPM. As a corollary, ade-
quate resources—personnel, facilities, tools, test equipment,  training, 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
13
engineering, and administrative support—should be devoted to 
EPM. Adequate support from design engineering and operations are 
especially important.
EPM activities should be prioritized according to the criticality of the 
systems and equipment involved, with the highest resource  intensity 
and scheduling priority assigned to equipment, subsystems, and 
systems important to safety.
EPM should be performed according to unambiguous written proce-
dures based on specifi c consideration of equipment, application, and 
environmental characteristics.
EPM procedures and schedules should be maintained and reviewed in 
order to ensure engineering review of procedural changes and the 
incorporation of plant modifi cations.
The EPM program should have provisions to take effective advan-
tage of actual experience accumulated both in the plant and else-
where (e.g., as professional society and industry association 
publications, and informal communications with other interested 
organizations).
The EPM program should incorporate effective provisions for failure 
root cause analysis, correction, and recurrence control.
Information systems should be in place to record and update the plant 
maintenance, testing, and operating history, and to facilitate trend-
ing of test data, in support of the previous two criteria.
EPM should be performed only by appropriately qualifi ed personnel. 
(See Section 1.3.3.)
Management should continually monitor and reevaluate the effective-
ness of the EPM program, and make appropriate changes in response 
to identifi ed programmatic problems and advances in maintenance 
technology.
By clear implication, the “RTF” and “inspect and service as necessary” phi-
losophies described earlier fail to provide enough structure, direction, and 
monitoring to satisfy the criteria for a sound EPM approach. These philoso-
phies are not acceptable for important equipment and systems. At a mini-
mum, a scheduled EPM program is clearly necessary.
1.3.3 Qualifications of EPM Personnel
The minimum acceptable qualifi cations for personnel assigned to perform 
EPM depend on the type of maintenance and the type of the equipment to be 
maintained. It is normally acceptable for nonspecialists personnel to perform 
superfi cial inspections and other undemanding EPM tasks when guided by 
defi ned procedures and acceptance criteria. However, effective administrative 
controls should be in place to ensure that critical PM tasks on important equip-
ment and systems are performed only by—or at least under the immediate and 
active supervision of—appropriately trained and experienced maintenance 

14 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
technicians. Such tasks typically include internal inspection, testing,  calibration, 
and refurbishment.
Training for critical EPM work on important equipment and systems 
should include at least the following:
The fundamentals of electrical power technology
• 
General electrical maintenance techniques
• 
Electrical safety methods and practices
• 
The design and operation of the equipment and system to be 
• 
maintained
The applicable maintenance and testing procedures required for the 
• 
maintenance and testing of the equipment
For critical tasks, technicians’ experience should include similar work on the 
same or closely comparable equipment, preferably in an operational environ-
ment, although experience acquired in a training environment under direct 
supervision of experienced instructors is acceptable.
With regard to electrical safety methods and practices, the National Fire 
Protection Association (NFPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) have promulgated new guidelines and require-
ments to protect workers from shock and fl ash hazards. The NFPA 70E, 
Article 110.8 (B) (1) requires safety-related work practices to be used to pro-
tect employees who might be exposed to the electrical hazards involved 
when working on live parts operating at 50 V or more. Appropriate safety-
related work practices shall be determined before any person approaches 
exposed live parts within the limited approach boundary by using both 
shock hazard and fl ash hazard analyses. Similarly, OSHA 1910.335(a)(1)(i) 
requires employees working in areas where there are potential electrical 
hazards to be provided with, and to use, electrical protective equipment 
that is appropriate for the specifi c parts of the body to be protected and for 
the work to be performed. Also in accordance with OSHA 1910.132(d), the 
employer is required to assess the workplace hazard to determine the use 
of personal protective equipment (PPE) required to protect the worker from 
shock and fl ash hazards. The NFPA 70E and OSHA requirements for shock 
and arc-fl ash hazards and guidelines for performing such an analysis are 
covered in more detail in Chapter 13, Sections 13.2 and 13.3. The mainte-
nance of protective devices and its impact on arc-fl ash hazard are covered 
in Section 1.7 of Chapter 1.
1.3.4 Optimization of PM Intervals
Experience in a variety of industries demonstrates that performing PM on an 
absolutely fi xed schedule rarely results in the optimum balance among the 
costs of preventive and corrective maintenance and the safety and produc-
tivity benefi ts of equipment reliability and availability. Given an adequate 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
15
historical failure and maintenance database, reasonably straightforward 
methods can be used to optimize the PM cycle.
Also, several industry standards such as National Electrical Code (NEC) 
Standard 70B, National Electrical Testing Association (NETA) maintenance 
specifi cations, and others including manufacturer’s recommendations pro-
vide guidelines on the frequency of maintenance of electrical equipment 
which could be used to establish EPM cycle.
1.3.5 Trending of Test Results
Systematic trending of EPM test results is a key element of a high-quality 
electrical maintenance program. This is true because the magnitudes (pass 
or fail value) of many of the parameters measured during EPM tests on 
equipment are poor predictors of future failures, unless they are so far out 
of the normal range that they indicate imminent and probably irretrievable 
failure. Examples include insulation resistance, leakage current, capaci-
tance, PF, and dissipation factor (DF); bearing temperature and vibration; 
and winding temperature. However, a degrading trend in these parame-
ters strongly indicates impending trouble, especially if the trend is acceler-
ating. A sound trending program can often alert the maintenance and 
operations staff of the plant in time to arrest the degradation and avert the 
failure, or at least to minimize the effect of the failure on safety and 
productivity.
To provide meaningful information, the trending program must be 
structured to screen the effects of external factors which affect the mea-
sured results but which are irrelevant to the actual condition of the equip-
ment health and reliability. Test procedures should mandate precautions 
to ensure that the external conditions which can affect the test results 
remain the same from test to test, or to correct the results when this 
is impractical. (For example, insulation resistances readings taken at vary-
ing temperatures are corrected to a common base temperature.) Typical 
irrelevant external conditions that affect electrical test results include tem-
perature, humidity, and load.
1.3.6 Systematic Failure Analysis Approach
Failure analysis and root cause investigation should be an integral part of 
any EPM program. The steps to be taken after a failure is observed are
 
1. Use a failure cause analysis to determine the proximate cause of the 
failure. The proximate cause is expressed in terms of the piece-part-
level failure, e.g., relay XX failed to transfer due to corroded 
contacts.
 
2. Compare the proximate cause to past failures or conditions on the 
same and similar equipment to determine if the problem has a 

16 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
systematic root cause, e.g., a chemically active environment in the 
example cited above.
 
3. If there appears to be no systematic root cause, correct the failure, 
resume operation, and continue performance monitoring. If there is a 
discernible root cause, initiate a structured root cause investigation.
 
4. If the problem is generic, contact other affected plants and manufac-
turers of the equipment to determine if they have taken any effective 
corrective actions. If so, adapt these actions to the specifi c circum-
stances of the affected equipment; if not, proceed to the next step.
 
5. If the problem is plant-specifi c, or if it is generic but no effective solution 
has been developed elsewhere, determine if it is attributable to a unique 
system design, to application or environmental factors, or to operational 
factors such as maintenance, testing, and operations practices.
 
6. If the problem is determined to be related to system design, equip-
ment application, or environment, determine the specifi c defi ciency 
(through special tests performance monitoring, environmental mon-
itoring, etc.), and make appropriate corrections.
 
7. If the problem is related to faulty operations, identify and correct the 
specifi c procedures involved.
 
8. Determine whether the root cause of the problem is a programmatic 
defi ciency, e.g., in procedures writing, training, supervision, or ade-
quacy of resources, and make appropriate corrections.
 
9. Perform the necessary postcorrection testing and monitoring to 
close out the problem and ensure that it is corrected.
1.3.6.1 Postmaintenance Testing
Postmaintenance testing provides the best assurance that maintenance actions 
were accomplished correctly and that the system or component was returned to 
functional condition. Postmaintenance testing is heavily emphasized in the 
better-performing plants. In these organizations, postmaintenance tests are 
performed following any action that potentially affects the operability of a com-
ponent/subsystem/system and the scope of the testing is broad enough to con-
fi rm all of the potentially affected functions. Associated systems, subsystems, 
or components are tested along with the systems, subsystems, or components 
which initiated the process if an engineering analysis indicates that the mainte-
nance action could have a signifi cant impact on these associated items.
1.3.6.2 Engineering Support
Engineering support is intended to ensure that the PM program properly 
addresses the engineering and logistical aspects of maintenance. In view of 
this broad objective, engineering support of maintenance encompasses much 
of the engineering and management activity that takes place in a plant. This 
includes at least the following functions:

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
17
Maintenance engineering
• 
System engineering
• 
Design engineering
• 
Training
• 
Spare parts and materials management
• 
Quality assurance
• 
Quality control
• 
There are, of course, many other areas of maintenance involvement with 
engineering support groups. The intent here is to show areas which stand 
out in the better-performing plants and which tend to be missing or under-
developed in other organizations.
Maintenance engineering is the engineering support activity most directly 
involved with PM. This function is present in all of the better-performing 
plants, although its name and where it fi ts into the organization vary widely 
from plant to plant. Its purpose is to optimize the maintenance program 
through planning, feedback, continual evaluation, and periodic updating of 
policies and procedures. The functions of a maintenance engineering group 
typically include
Maintenance procedure development and control
• 
Periodic review and updating of maintenance practices and 
• 
procedures
Maintenance recordkeeping
• 
In-service inspection and testing (ISI/IST) program development
• 
Providing guidance to the training staff on maintenance training
• 
Collecting and trending equipment failure, reliability, availability, 
• 
and maintainability data
Tracking and trending the corrective- to preventive-maintenance ratio
• 
Failure root cause analysis
• 
Tracking, trending, and analysis of nonconformances
• 
Identifying and monitoring maintenance-related equipment perfor-
• 
mance parameters, especially failure precursors
Identifying and monitoring maintenance performance indicators
• 
1.3.6.3 Summary
The foregoing has been a brief look at the features of the EPM program. There 
are many ways to effect improvements in an organization, but probably the 
dominant cause of failing to improve is resistance to change. In the plants 
that have outstanding maintenance organizations, upper management has 

18 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
overcome this resistance by direct, long-term involvement in establishing 
and implementing policies leading to improved maintenance. Perceptible 
improvements in reliability, availability, and thermal effi ciency have gener-
ally resulted; the indirect results have been both greater safety and higher 
profi ts. The changes in these organizations were not easy and required both 
time and dedication to implement. Effective management appears to be the 
key to an effective overall maintenance organization, not the number of 
 programs management has in place.
1.4 Planning an EPM Program
There are management, economic, and technical considerations as discussed 
in Section 1.3 along with other requirements that need to be understood in 
order to develop an effective maintenance program. Let us review these items 
from the viewpoint of developing an effective and comprehensive mainte-
nance program. The main parts of the maintenance program can be classifi ed 
into maintenance management considerations, technical requirements, and 
those items that should be included in the EPM program.
1.4.1 Maintenance Management Considerations
The design of any maintenance program must meet the ultimate goals of 
plant management. Maintenance is like an insurance policy: it has no direct 
payback, yet it is a cost that adds to the cost of the fi nal product. However, one 
must hasten to say that it has inherent paybacks such as those listed in Section 
1.2. It is generally observed that management resists the investment in a main-
tenance program even though they realize the need for good maintenance. 
In view of this, it is up to electrical personnel to show management how a 
properly planned electrical maintenance and testing program is justifi able.
The planning of EPM programs should then include the advantages of a 
well-planned maintenance along with cost data for lost production due to 
equipment failure versus cost of budgeted PM. Any maintenance program 
should prove that it is cost effective and minimizes equipment failure. The 
planning of the program should include considerations for proper test equip-
ment, tools, trained personnel to carry out maintenance tasks, and time 
required to perform inspections, tests, and maintenance routines. Also, con-
sideration should be given to record keeping systems, which can range from 
fully computerized to manual fi le systems. To set up an EPM and test pro-
gram, the following steps may be undertaken:
Determine the factors that will form the basis of the maintenance pro-
• 
gram, such as the necessity for continuous production, management 
policy on budgeting for planned maintenance versus replacement of 
equipment, and the like.

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
19
Survey and consolidate data on equipment breakdowns and cost of 
• 
lost production. Make an analysis of the cost data to convince man-
agement of the benefi ts of planned maintenance.
Establish electrical maintenance priorities. These consist of on-line 
• 
production sequence, most important to least important equipment, 
weighing the reliability of the equipment, and other factors.
Establish the best maintenance techniques. This involves selecting 
• 
the best maintenance method and personnel for the various types of 
equipment and systems.
Schedule and implement the program. Monitor its benefi ts and costs. 
• 
Analyze program functions periodically for improvement of the 
program.
After the program has been set up, it is essential that it consist of elements that 
will prove it to be a success such as responsibilities, inspection, scheduling, 
work orders, and record keeping.
1.4.1.1 Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the maintenance organization should be clearly 
defi ned by organization charts with functional work statements for each 
unit. The functional work statements must be established by management as 
a matter of policy. Every other department must be informed of the respon-
sibilities assigned to maintenance organizations. The effectiveness of the 
maintenance departments will depend upon how well they are organized 
and how well personnel are utilized.
1.4.1.2 Inspection
Inspection is the key to the success of any maintenance program. Suffi cient 
time should be allocated for inspection to verify the condition of new and 
installed equipment. The purpose of inspection is to provide advance warn-
ing as to the condition of the equipment under investigation. When  inspection 
is performed on defi nite cycles by qualifi ed people, impending deterioration 
can be detected in advance so that repair or replacement can be made before 
failure of the equipment occurs.
1.4.1.3 Scheduling
To perform maintenance, a defi nite schedule of work to be performed must be 
established. Maintenance schedules must be based upon minimum downtime 
for the various operating segments. The schedule for inspection, routine main-
tenance, and other work may vary for different equipment and will depend 
upon many factors. These factors can be age of equipment, frequency of  service, 
hours of operation, environmental conditions, damage due to abuse, and safety 
requirements. Frequency of scheduling of all tasks should be adjusted as data 

20 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
on various equipment are recorded and analyzed to provide a balance between 
cost of maintenance and replacement cost of the equipment.
1.4.1.4 Work Orders
Work orders are job requests that need action for completion. Work orders 
can be established for all inspection service and other work on equipment in 
terms of routines. Any of these routines should include information on when 
such work is to be performed, where it is to be performed, and exactly what 
has to be done. These routines can be generated by a computer-based main-
tenance system. The routines should include all the pertinent information 
concerning the equipment.
1.4.1.5 Record Keeping
The success of a planned maintenance program depends upon the impetus 
given by top management and the interest of the maintenance personnel in 
the program. To have an effective program, it is imperative that maintenance 
and test inventory data on all equipment should be complete and readily 
available throughout the service life of the equipment. To that end, record 
keeping is very important. All forms and reports should be organized to 
provide ready accessibility to data when needed and to fl ag down problem 
areas. Such data may also be used over the years to analyze trends for equip-
ment deterioration. If data are not recorded and maintained properly, the 
whole purpose of planned maintenance is lost.
1.4.2 Technical Requirements
Technical requirements can be stated as follows:
Survey of plant equipment
• 
Listing of plant equipment in the order of critical importance
• 
Plan to perform EPM on a regular frequency
• 
Development of instructions and procedures for the EPM program
• 
1.4.2.1 Survey of Plant Equipment
To perform an effective EPM program, it is necessary to have accurate data 
about the electrical power system. This may include one-line diagrams, 
short-circuit coordination study, wiring and control diagrams, and other 
data that can be used as a reference point for future maintenance and testing. 
The purpose of these diagrams is to document and serve as an offi cial record 
of equipment and circuit installation. The National Electrical Manufacturer’s 
Association (NEMA) has established standards for diagram symbols, device 
designations, and electrical symbols. The types of diagrams and drawings in 
common use are the following:

tionship of subsystems in pictorial form.
Block diagram: A group of interconnected blocks, each of which represents a

symbols, the fl ow of electrical power or the course of electrical circuits and 
how they are connected. In this diagram, physical relationships are usually 
disregarded. A typical one-line diagram is shown in Figure 1.4.

controllers and associated equipment or between various housing units of 
an assembly of switchgear apparatus as shown in Figure 1.5c.
Circuit layout and routing diagram: They show the physical layout of the  facility 
and equipment and how the circuit to the various equipment is run.
Short-circuit coordination study: An electrical power system data, diagrams, 
and drawings are needed during maintenance and testing of electrical equip-
ment. This may involve information and data relating to protective devices 
and relays. Such data are usually found in a short-circuit coordination study 
and usually encompass all the short-circuit values available in the power 
system, relays, and trip device settings. Normally, this study is performed 
during the construction and commissioning phase of the facility. It would be 
much more desirable to perform this engineering study as part of the initial 
facility design, and then validate it during the construction phase to assure 
that equipment and values specifi ed have been met. When accepting the 
facility, this study data should be used as a benchmark, and any changes that 
may have been made during construction in the system should be incorpo-
rated to update the study for future references.
System diagrams: In addition to other data assembled, system diagrams will 
generally be needed for large systems. Such diagrams may consist of the 
following:
Control and monitoring system
Lighting system
Ventilation system
Heating and air conditioning system
Emergency system
Other systems
All the system diagrams may interface with one another, such as electrical 
diagrams, fi re and security diagrams, emergency power, hydraulic, pneumatic, 
and/or mechanical systems. Therefore, it is important to know how these inter-
faces work and how they can be coordinated in the maintenance program.
1.4.2.2  Listing of Plant Equipment in the Order
of Critical Importance
Electrical power system equipment, like any other plant equipment, is vital 
to the operation of the plant or facility. Failure of the power system may be 
considered a serious threat to people and property. The listing may be diffi -
cult to accomplish because the criticalness of any piece of equipment will 
vary for each plant or facility. Therefore, a team to mutually identify and list 
the critical equipment (electrical and other) vital to the operation of a facility 
may be necessary. The team should consist of representatives from each area 

24 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
of expertise involved in the operation of the plant. All the critical equipment 
and/or systems should be identifi ed on the drawings. The maintenance 
department should understand each of these systems, equipment, and/or 
their functions and how they may affect or interface with other systems. The 
more knowledgeable the maintenance members are about their system, the 
better job they will perform in their duties.
1.4.2.3 Plan to Perform EPM on Regular Frequency
Several factors should be considered in establishing the frequency with 
which equipment is to be maintained:
Environmental conditions
• 
Load conditions
• 
Duty requirements
• 
Critical nature of the equipment
• 
The purpose of the maintenance schedule is to establish the condition of the 
equipment and determine what work will be required before its next 
 scheduled maintenance. Usually, manufacturers’ service manuals specify 
recommended frequency of maintenance and/or inspection. These time 
intervals are based upon standard operating conditions and environments. 
If these standard conditions change for the equipment, then the frequency 
should be modifi ed accordingly. However, once the frequency of scheduled 
maintenance is established, this schedule should be adhered to for at least 
several maintenance cycles. The schedule should be adjusted if the equip-
ment begins to experience unexpected failures. The frequency in this case 
can be reduced by as much as 50%. On the other hand, if the equipment does 
not require maintenance for more than two inspections, the period of fre-
quency for that equipment can be increased by as much as 50%. Adjustment 
should be  continued until the optimum interval is found. Generally, the test 
frequency can vary from 6 months to 3 years.
1.4.2.4  Development of Instruction and Procedures 
for the EPM Program
The fi nal technical function in developing an EPM program involves estab-
lishment of instructions, procedures, and methods to ensure that the equip-
ment and system components operate without failure. The maintenance 
department should have fully developed procedures and instructions for 
thoroughly servicing all equipment and components. In addition, the main-
tenance department should also develop shutdown procedures, safeguards, 
interlocking of equipment, alarms, and methods of recording data (forms) 
and reporting unusual conditions to the proper authority. The maintenance 
records should be further utilized to evaluate results and as an indicator of 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
25
possible modifi cations or changes in the maintenance program. In other 
words, the recorded information should be used as historical data and for 
feedback to modify the maintenance program.
1.4.3 What Should Be Included in the EPM Program
The EPM and testing program should encompass the following activities:
EPM and testing
• 
Electrical repairs
• 
Analysis of failures
• 
Trending of maintenance and testing data
• 
To have an effective and effi cient operation, it is essential to carry out these 
four activities.
1.4.3.1 EPM and Testing
This activity involves inspection, cleaning and adjustment, and testing of 
equipment to ensure trouble-free operation until its next scheduled mainte-
nance. PM and testing also allow the prediction of impending failure of a 
particular piece of equipment so that plans can be made to replace it without 
catastrophic results. The information on testing can be obtained from several 
different sources such as manufacturer’s manuals, published literature on 
specifi c equipment, and industry standards. The relevant industry standards 
are: the Insulated Cable Engineering Association (ICEA), NFPA, Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), American National Standard 
Institute (ANSI), NEMA, NETA, Insurance Company Manuals (ICMs), and 
others, depending on the equipment to be tested.
1.4.3.2 Electrical Repairs
The repair of electrical equipment and related machinery associated with 
plant production is the fundamental requirement of good maintenance pro-
grams. The maintenance should be performed economically and expedi-
tiously. The basic objective of the maintenance program should be to avoid 
unexpected breakdowns of equipment. Furthermore, when breakdowns occur, 
spare parts should be on hand to make the necessary repairs. The mainte-
nance personnel should be properly trained to  perform the repairs promptly 
and correctly in order to minimize the downtime of the equipment.
1.4.3.3 Analysis of Failures
The failure of electrical equipment should be analyzed to assess reasons for 
its breakdown. Unless the cause is obvious, the equipment quality may be 
questioned. Reliability can be built into the equipment, but it requires upkeep 

26 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
to retain it. The tendency to ignore regular maintenance and testing generally 
prevails over regularly scheduled maintenance because regular maintenance 
may be considered unnecessary and too expensive. Therefore, the best 
designed and built equipment may break down through lack of attention. 
Every failure should be analyzed for its cause so that corrective measures can 
be implemented to prevent similar breakdowns.
1.4.3.4 Trending of Maintenance and Testing Data
Systematic trending of maintenance and testing data (see Section 1.3.5) can 
alert the maintenance staff of degrading equipment. This allows the mainte-
nance staff to monitor such equipment more closely or take corrective actions 
to avert a catastrophic failure.
1.4.3.5 Computerized Maintenance Management System
It is essential to have a CMMS for implementing an effective maintenance 
program. In the past, the maintenance data were manually recorded and 
managed. It was time consuming and diffi cult to record data and perform 
trend analysis of the maintenance test results. Today, most maintenance 
tasks can be automated with the use of commercially available CMMS 
 programs and a desktop or a laptop computer. The job of maintaining and 
managing maintenance and test data has become much easier compared to 
the past. A CMMS is essential for improving performance, analyzing data 
for key trends and anomalies, forecasting reliability issues, and in making 
forward-looking decisions that deliver improved bottom-line results. 
A comprehensive CMMS program can incorporate all of the elements dis-
cussed in Sections 1.4.1.2 through 1.4.3.4 and make the electrical mainte-
nance department an effective organization. Typical key functions of CMMS 
include the following:
Work orders—scheduling jobs, assigning personnel, reserving materials, 
and recording costs.
PM—keeping track of PM inspections, tests, and jobs, including step-
by-step instructions or checklists, lists of materials required, and 
other pertinent details.
Asset management—recording data on equipment including specifi ca-
tions, nameplate information, purchase date, maintenance history, 
inspection and test data, and so on.
Inventory control—management of spare parts, tools, and other 
materials.
Critical equipment listing and inventory—list of critical equipment vital to 
the operation of the facility.
Root cause analysis of failures—analysis of failures and their causes so that 
corrective measures can be implemented to prevent similar failures.

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
27
Advanced reporting and analytics—creating customized reports and 
analyses that can be used to forecast likely problems in time to 
prevent them.
There are number of vendors that offer CMMS for the management of 
electrical maintenance and testing data and reporting such as Megger 
“PowerDB,” Service Automation Technologies “EPower Forms,” and Optima-
SMS. For example, PowerDB∗ is a powerful software package for entry and 
management of acceptance (start-up) and maintenance test data, storage and 
reporting. The system allows the user to defi ne data forms for different 
equipment types. When testing equipment, these forms are used to facilitate 
data entry, on-screen data presentation, and report printing. Equipment is 
organized in an organization scheme of up to fi ve levels. This software 
is designed to work as the Equipment Tree. The Equipment Tree levels are 
labeled as customer, user, plant, substation, and position. Data entry and 
reporting for one or more pieces of equipment are organized into jobs. 
PowerDB stores information in a database. Subsets of the database may be 
made for fi eld-testing. Results, changes, and additions to the subset may 
be merged with the master database. All types of test results can be entered 
and stored into the software for generating formal reports and a permanent 
historical record. The PowerDB CMMS program is designed to record and 
manage the maintenance and test data for the many of the electrical equip-
ment including the following: batteries, cables, circuit breakers, coordination 
data, disconnects, generators and motors, power transformers, insulation 
fl uids, loadbreak switches, motor control centers (MCCs), relays, PF tests, 
switchboards, transfer switches, watt-hour meters transducers, ground fault 
tests; ground mat/grid tests; instrument transformers, and so on.
The user interface for viewing or recalling information is also the actual 
test or inspection entry form. Various forms for each type of apparatus allow

1.5 Overview of Testing and Test Methods
Testing of electrical equipment is usually performed in the fi eld on new equip-
ment after installation and on existing equipment to assess its condition. The 
manufacturer conducts electrical tests on equipment before it leaves the 
 factory; these tests, known as factory tests, are outside the scope of this text 
and therefore will not be discussed. Field tests are conducted to see whether 
newly installed equipment has been damaged, to indicate whether any correc-
tive maintenance or replacement is necessary on existing equipment, to indi-
cate if the equipment can continue to perform its design functions safely and 
adequately, to chart the gradual deterioration of the equipment over its service 
life, and to check new equipment before energization. In view of these objec-
tives, the electrical testing of equipment can be divided into the following:
Types of tests
• 
Types of testing methods
• 
1.5.1 Types of Tests
The types of fi eld tests are acceptance tests, routine maintenance tests, and 
special maintenance tests that are conducted for specifi c purposes.
1.5.1.1 Acceptance Tests
These tests are known as start-up or commissioning tests and are performed on 
new equipment, usually after installation and prior to energization. When 
these tests are repeated within a year, that is before the warranty period expires, 
then these tests are referred to as proof tests. Tests of this type are made at 80% 
of the fi nal factory test voltage value. They are run to determine the following:
Whether the equipment is in compliance with the specifi cation
To establish a benchmark for future tests
To determine that the equipment has been installed without damage
To verify whether the equipment meets its design intent and limit
1.5.1.2 Routine Maintenance Tests
These tests are performed at regular intervals over the service life of the 
equipment. They are made concurrently with PM and at 60% of the fi nal 
 factory test voltage value. In the course of routine maintenance tests, it is 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
29
very helpful to record the information as it is found on the equipment and to 
also record the condition in which the equipment is left. Therefore, these 
tests can be further subdivided into the following:
As-found tests: These tests are performed on equipment on receipt or 
after it has been taken out of service for maintenance, but before any 
maintenance work is done.
As-left tests: These tests are performed after maintenance has been 
performed and just before reenergization. They can indicate the 
degree of improvement in the equipment and service as a  benchmark 
for comparison for future tests.
1.5.1.3 Special Maintenance Tests
These tests are performed on equipment that is known to be defective or 
has been subjected to adverse conditions that may affect its operating char-
acteristics. An example might be the fault interruption by a circuit breaker, 
which requires inspection, maintenance, and tests before it can be put back 
into service.
1.5.2 Types of Testing Methods
The testing of electrical power system equipment involves checking the insu-
lation system, electrical properties, and other factors as they relate to the 
overall operation of the power system. Therefore, testing of electrical equip-
ment can be divided into the following types:
Solid insulation testing
• 
Insulating liquid testing
• 
Relay and protective device testing
• 
Circuit breaker time–travel analysis
• 
Grounding electrode resistance testing
• 
Fault gas analysis testing
• 
Infrared inspection testing
• 
1.5.2.1 Solid Insulation Testing
Insulation can be either solid, liquid, or gaseous dielectric materials that 
 prevent the fl ow of electricity between points of different potential. Insulation 
testing is done to determine the integrity of the insulating medium. 
This  usually consists of applying a high potential (hi-pot) voltage to the 
sample under test and determining the leakage current that may fl ow under 
test conditions. Excessive leakage current fl ows may indicate a deteriorated 
condition or impending failure of the insulation. Insulation testing can be 
performed by applying either direct current (DC) voltage or alternating 

30 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
current (AC) voltage. The testing of solid insulation with these voltages can 
be categorized as nondestructive testing and destructive testing, respec-
tively. The destructive test may cause equipment under test to fail or render 
it unsuitable for further service. Nondestructive tests are performed at low-
voltage stress, and the equipment under test is rarely damaged.
The AC hi-pot test is primarily a “go” or “no-go” test. The voltage is raised 
to a specifi ed level. If the equipment fails or shows excessive leakage current, 
the equipment under test is unusable. If the equipment does not fail, it has 
passed the test. This test can only indicate whether the equipment is good or 
bad. It cannot indicate with what safety margin the test was passed. However, 
there are nondestructive tests that can be performed with AC voltage, such as 
power factor (PF), dissipation factor (DF), capacitance, etc., which are dis-
cussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.
The DC hi-pot test can indicate more than a “go” or “no-go” condition. 
It can indicate that equipment is all right at the present time but may fail in 
the future. DC testing is done to obtain information for comparative analysis 
on a periodic basis. With dc testing, the leakage current is measured during 
the progress of the test and compared to leakage current values of previous 
tests. However, the DC hi-pot test is considered to be a destructive test if the 
test voltage is not applied in a predetermined control-voltage steps. The DC 
voltage tests can be performed at lower voltages, which are nondestructive 
tests, such as insulation resistance, dielectric absorption ratio, and polariza-
tion index. These tests are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
1.5.2.2 Insulating Liquid Testing
Insulating liquids used in transformers or other electrical apparatus are sub-
ject to deterioration and contamination over a period of time. These contami-
nants have a detrimental effect on the insulating properties of the fl uid, 
as well as on the solid insulation system of the transformer winding. Basically, 
the elements that cause the deterioration of the insulating fl uids are mois-
ture, heat, oxygen, and other catalysts that result in a chemical reaction that 
produces acid and sludge, which in turn attack the insulating fl uids. The 
main insulating fl uids that are in use today for transformers are oil, silicone, 
and RTemp and Wecosol. Askarel was used in the past, but its use was 
banned by federal regulations owing to its high toxicity; however, there may 
be installations that still may have this fl uid at their plant sites. Regular tests 
are recommended to monitor the condition of the insulating liquid. Samples 
should be taken from the transformers on periodic basis to perform various 
tests in accordance with American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) 
methods, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
1.5.2.3 Protective Device Testing
Protective device testing involves the testing and maintenance of protective 
relays, low-voltage draw out power circuit breakers, low-voltage molded-case 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
31
breakers, and associated equipment such as instrument transformers and 
wiring. The function of protective relays and devices maintenance and test-
ing is to assure that a particular breaker or protective relay is able to perform 
its basic protective function under actual operating conditions. The tests on 
relays, protective trip devices, and circuit breakers can be classifi ed as com-
missioning tests, routine maintenance testing, and verifi cation testing. These 
tests are discussed in more detail in Chapters 7 through 9.
1.5.2.4 Circuit Breaker Time–Travel Analysis
The circuit breaker time–travel analysis test is performed to determine if the 
operating mechanism of the circuit breaker is operating properly. This test is 
usually performed on medium- and high-voltage circuit breakers and depicts 
the position of breaker contacts with relation to time. This relationship can 
then be used to determine the operating speed of the circuit breaker for 
opening and closing and contact bounce, and the interval time for closing 
and tripping. The breaker operating time data can be used to evaluate the 
condition of mechanical parts of breakers, such as closing mechanism, 
springs, and shock absorbers. Circuit breaker time–travel analysis test is 
described in greater detail in Chapter 7.
1.5.2.5 Grounding Electrode Resistance Testing
The integrity of the grounding system is very important in an electrical 
power system for the following reasons:
To maintain a reference point of potential (ground) for equipment and 
personnel safety
To provide a discharge point for traveling waves due to lightning
To prevent excessive high voltage due to induced voltages on the power 
system
Therefore, to maintain ground potential effectiveness, periodic testing of 
grounding electrodes and the grounding system is required. Electrical power 
system grounding and ground resistance measurements are discussed in 
greater detail in Chapter 11.
1.5.2.6 Fault Gas Analysis Testing
Fault gas analysis testing comprises of dissolved gas analysis and total com-
bustible gas tests. The dissolved-gas analysis provides information on the 
individual combustible gases dissolved in the insulating oil. The total com-
bustible fault gas analysis test provides information on incipient faults in oil-
fi lled transformers by measuring the total combustible gases present in the 
nitrogen cap of the transformer. Because of excessive heat due to loading of 

32 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
the transformer, or arcing and sparking inside the transformer insulating oil, 
some of the oil in the transformer decomposes and generates combustible 
gases, which then are dissolved in the oil, and eventually become liberated 
where they mix with the nitrogen above the top oil. The dissolved oil gas and 
total combustible gas test methods are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
1.5.2.7 Infrared Inspection Testing
There are many different devices available using infrared technology to 
check hot spots in switchgear and other energized parts of the power system. 
They are very useful in routine maintenance and inspection for fi nding bad 
connections and joints and overloaded terminals or lines. The infrared 
inspection testing is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8.
1.6 Review of Dielectric Theory and Practice
All electrical circuits use insulation which is suppose to be nonconductive 
and confi nes and guides the electric current to the inside of the circuit. 
Therefore, the electrical insulation materials should exhibit (1) high resis-
tance to the fl ow of electrical current, (2) high strength to withstand electrical 
stress, and (3) excellent heat-conducting properties. There are three funda-
mental electrical circuits and they are (1) the electric circuit, (2) the dielectric 
circuit, and (3) the magnetic circuit. These three circuits are analogous in 
many respects and are all governed by Ohm’s law. For example, each of the 
three circuits can be written as follows:
 
The electric circuit is
E
I
R

The dielectric circuit is

The magnetic circuit is

I is the current in the electrical circuit
y is the electrical fl ux in the dielectric circuit
Φ is the magnetic fl ux in the magnetic circuit

Although these circuits are analogous to one another, they differ in actual 
practice. In the electrical circuit, the circuit is confi ned to the inside of the 
conductor and its path is along the conductor, where as in the dielectric and 
magnetic circuits the length of the path is short, irregular, and there is a large 
proportion of leakage fl ux usually into the air. In practice, it is much more 
diffi cult to make precise calculations for the dielectric and magnetic circuits 
than it is for the electric circuits. Furthermore, the current in the electric cir-
cuit can be measured very readily where as it is much more diffi cult to make 
similar measurements in the dielectric and magnetic circuits. In particular, 
the  dielectric circuit differs further from an electric and magnetic circuit is in 
its design,  predictability, and reliability. The dielectric circuit involves several 
terms and parameters that need to be understood in order to assess the 
 characteristics and performance of the dielectric circuit. These terms are 
 discussed as follows:
Dielectric: Dielectric is a term used to identify a medium, such as 
insulation in which an electric fi eld charge can be produced and 
maintained. The energy required to charge the dielectric is recover-
able, in whole or in part, when the charge is removed.
Dielectric constant: Dielectric constant is known as specifi c inductive 
capacitance, capacitivity, or permittivity. The dielectric constant of 
any medium or material is defi ned as the ratio of the capacitance of 
a given confi guration of electrodes with the medium as a dielectric, 
to the capacitance of the same confi guration with a vacuum (or air) 
as the dielectric between the electrodes.
Dielectric absorption: Dielectric absorption is a phenomenon which 
occurs in dielectrics whereby positive and negative charges are 
separated to  respective polarity when a DC voltage is applied to the 
dielectric. This phenomenon is time-dependent and usually manifests 
itself as a gradually decreasing current with time after application of 
DC voltage.

34 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Dielectric loss: Dielectric loss is the time rate at which electric energy is 
 transformed into heat in a dielectric when it is subjected to an electric 
fi eld. Dielectric loss is associated with real component (watts) losses 
in a dielectric.
Dielectric PF: The dielectric PF of a material is the ratio of the power 
 dissipated in the material in watts (watt loss) to the effective volt-
amperes (effective voltage × current) when tested with sinusoidal 
(AC) voltage. Numerically, it is expressed as a cosine of the dielectric 
phase angle (q) or cos q.
Dielectric DF: The dielectric DF is the tangent of the loss angle (90 − q). 
It is commonly referred to as tan d (tan delta).
Dielectric loss factor or dielectric loss index: The dielectric loss factor of 
any material is the product of its dielectric constant and its DF.
Dielectric strength: The dielectric strength of a material is the potential 
gradient (voltage) at which breakdown (electrical failure) occurs and 
is a function of the material thickness and its electrical properties.
Voltage gradient: A voltage gradient is defi ned as the electrical  intensity 
at a point in an electric fi eld, that is, force exerted on unit charge at a 
point. Numerically, it is equal to the density of the electric fl ux 
divided by the dielectric constant.
1.6.1 Characteristics of Dielectrics (Insulation)
Dielectrics (insulation) for electrical equipment and apparatus is used for 
many different applications. It is expressed for a wide range of  environmental 
conditions such as temperature, moisture, chemicals, other contaminants, 
and exposure to weather. One major factor affecting insulation life is ther-
mal degradation, although moisture, contamination, voltage stress, and 
other factors may also contribute to its degradation. In addition, the life of an 
insulating material depends on the degree of loading, the type of service to 
which the equipment is subjected, the care it receives during installation and 
operation, and mechanical vibration and forces to which it is subjected.
The properties of insulating materials that are necessary and desirable are 
surface leakage, resistance to moisture, chemicals, oils and other contami-
nants, and mechanical properties. The important electrical characteristics of 
insulation are volume resistivity, PF, DF, capacitivity, dielectric constant, and 
dielectric strength. These characteristics, except for dielectric strength, can 
be assessed by nondestructive testing. These tests are
 
1. AC dielectric loss
 
2. PF or DF (tan d )
 
3. Capacitance
 
4. AC resistance
 
5. Radio interference voltage (RIV)

7. DC dielectric absorption
1.6.1.1 Dielectric Loss
All solid and liquid insulations have some measurable loss since there is no 
perfect insulator. These losses are usually very small in the insulations typi-
cally used in electrical equipment and apparatus, and these losses vary as the 
square of the applied voltage. Gaseous insulations, such as air, do not have a 
measurable loss until they become overstressed or ionized. Dielectric loss is 
measured in watts (resistive components) and is a measure of energy dissi-
pation through and over the surface of the insulation. The dielectric losses of 
most insulations increases with increase in temperature, moisture, and 
corona. Insulations may fail due to the cumulative effect of temperature, that 
is, rise in temperature causes an increase in dielectric loss which in turn 
results in a further rise in temperature. This phenomenon is self-perpetuating 
and continues until the insulation fails.
1.6.1.2 PF and DF
The PF of insulation is defi ned as the ratio of watt loss to total charging 
 volt-amperes, or the cosine of the angle q between total current vector (IT) 
and the impressed voltage vector. It is a measure of the energy component 
(resistive component) of the charging current. The DF is defi ned as the ratio 
of the watt loss to charging amperes, or the tangent of the angle d  between 
the total current vector and the capacitive current vector. The angle d is the 
complementary angle of the PF angle q. Although, the charging volt- amperes 
and watt loss increase as the volume of insulation being tested increases at 
a given test voltage, the ratio of watt loss to the volt-amperes (PF or DF) 
remains the same regardless of the volume of insulation tested. Therefore, 
the basic relationship of PF or DF eliminates the effect of the volume of insu-
lation—that is, the size of the electrical equipment or apparatus tested. This 
simplifi es the problem of establishing normal insulation values for most 
types of electrical equipment. PF and DF testing is discussed in greater 
detail in Chapter 3.
1.6.1.3 Capacitance
In a capacitor, the charge Q (amount of electricity) is proportional to the volt-
age E. The expression for this relationship can be written as
 
Q
CE
=
 
where C is a constant called capacitance. The capacitance of any electrical 
equipment, including capacitors, may be calculated from their geometry. 

36 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
A capacitor in its most simple form is the parallel-electrode air capacitor as 
shown in Figure 1.6a. The capacitance of such a capacitor can be calculated 
by the following formula:
 
KA
C
d
=
 
where
A is the area between the electrodes
d is the thickness of the insulation (spacing between the electrodes)
K is the dielectric constant of the insulation (air)
The dielectric constant (K) of air is practically unity and the dielectric con-
stant of the other insulation materials is defi ned in terms of air or vacuum. 
Table 1.1 gives the dielectric constant values for most common types of insu-
lating materials.
In cases where the geometry of the electrical equipment is simple and 
known, capacitance can be calculated mathematically. In the majority of 
cases, however, most insulation’s geometry is usually too complex and not 
well-enough understood to derive a reliable calculation of capacitance 
mathematically.
1.6.2 Insulation as a Capacitor
A perfect insulator can be represented by an ideal capacitor as shown in 
Figure 1.7a. However, all electrical equipment insulation have losses and 
therefore an insulator is not a pure capacitor. Thus, the electrical circuit of a

practical insulator can be represented by a capacitor with a small resistance 
in parallel with it, as shown in Figure 1.7b.
The nature of insulation materials is such that 60 Hz current does not easily 
fl ow through them and therefore their purpose is to guide the current to the 
inside of the conductor. When voltage is applied to the conductor, two fi elds 
are established; one due to the current fl ow (magnetic fi eld) and the other due 
to the voltage (dielectric or electrostatic fi eld). The lines of magnetic fl ux 
around the conductor are concentric circles, whereas the lines of the dielectric 
fl ux around the conductor are radial. The resulting voltage stress due to the 
dielectric fi eld varies inversely with the distance between equipotential lines.
The dielectric constant of an insulator is an indication of how much dielec-
tric fl ux the insulation will allow through it. Under identical conditions insu-
lation with a higher dielectric constant will pass more dielectric fl ux through 
it than another insulation having a lower dielectric constant. The dielectric 
constant for most commercial insulations varies from 2.0 to 7.0 as indicated 
in Table 1.1. It should be noted that the dielectric constant of water is 81 and 
generally when insulation becomes wet, its dielectric constant increases 
along with its capacitance, thus resulting in greater dielectric loss. An ideal 
insulation can be represented as a capacitor because its behavior is similar to 
that of a capacitor. Two of the most common confi gurations considered for 
insulators are parallel-plate and cylindrical capacitors. For example, the par-
allel-plate capacitor represents an insulation system of a transformer or a 
machine winding, whereas the cylindrical capacitor represents an insulation 
system of a cable or a bushing.
1.6.3 DC Voltage versus AC Voltage Tests
When voltage is applied to the insulation, a current is established consisting of 
a charging current (IC) and an in-phase component current (IR). As shown in 
Figure 1.7b, the charging current leads the in-phase component current by 90°.

is the total current (IT) drawn by the insulation specimen. The in-phase 
component current is also referred to as the resistive current, loss current, 
or conduction current. The ideal insulation (ideal capacitor) behaves some-
what differently under the application of DC versus AC voltages which are 
discussed below.
1.6.3.1 DC Voltage Tests
When a DC voltage is applied to the insulation, a large current is drawn at 
the beginning to provide the charging energy, however, this current decreases 
to a minimum level over time. The minimum current is due to continuous 
leakage or watt loss through the insulation. The energy required to charge 
an insulation is known as the dielectric absorption phenomenon.
In actual practice, the losses from dielectric absorption (i.e., the absorption 
current) are much higher than the continuous leakage losses. In the case of 
DC voltage testing, the effect of dielectric absorption becomes minimum over 
time and therefore measurements of continuous leakage current can be made. 
Dielectric absorption losses are very sensitive to changes in moisture content 
of an insulation, as well as the presence of other contaminants. Small increases 
in moisture content of an insulation cause a large increase in dielectric absorp-
tion. The fact that dielectric losses are due to dielectric absorption makes the 
dielectric loss, PF, or DF test a very sensitive test for detecting moisture in the 
insulation. When a DC voltage is applied to an insulation, the total current 
drawn by the insulation is comprised of capacitance charging current, dielec-
tric absorption current, and continuous leakage currents. These currents and 
their behavior are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2.
1.6.3.2 AC Voltage Tests
In the case of AC voltage application to an insulation, a large current is drawn 
which remains constant as the AC current alternately charges and discharges 
the insulation. The effect of dielectric absorption currents remains high because 
the dielectric fi eld never becomes fully established due to the polarity of the 
current reversing each half cycle. When an AC voltage is applied to an insulation, 
the currents drawn by the insulation are due to capacitance charging, dielectric 
absorption, continuous leakage current, and corona which are discussed below:
Capacitance charging current: In the case of AC voltage, this current is 
constant and is a function of voltage, the dielectric constant of the 
insulating material, and the geometry of the insulation.
Dielectric absorption current: When an electric fi eld is set up across an 
insulation, the dipole molecules try to align with the fi eld. Since the 
molecules in an AC fi eld are continually reversing and never fully 
align, the energy required is a function of material, contamination, 
(such as water), and electrical frequency. It is not a function of time.
Leakage current (conductivity): All insulation materials will conduct some 
current. If voltage is increased beyond a certain level, electrons will 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
39
be knocked off of molecules causing current to pass through the 
 insulation. This is a function of the material, contamination (espe-
cially water), and temperature. Excessive conductivity will generate 
heat causing the insulation to cascade into failure.
Corona (ionization current): Corona is the process by which neutral 
molecules of air disassociate to form positively and negatively charged 
ions. This occurs due to overstressing of an air void in the insulation. 
Air voids in oil or solid insulations may be due to deterioration from 
heat or physical stress, poor manufacture, faulty installation, or 
improper operation. Corona breaks down the air into ozone which, 
in combination with water, forms nitrous acid. The ionized air bom-
bards the surrounding insulation and causes heat. The combination of 
these conditions will result in deterioration of the insulation and carbon 
tracking. Corona losses increase exponentially as voltage increases.
1.6.4 Insulation Breakdown Modes
Insulation breakdown can be classifi ed as (1) failure due to excessive dielec-
tric loss and (2) failure due to overpotential stress. These failure modes are 
discussed below:
Excessive dielectric loss is the result of deteriorated insulation or the 
 contamination of the insulation with a poor dielectric such as water. As the 
dielectric losses increase, the temperature of the insulation increases result-
ing in even greater dielectric loss. Over time, the phenomenon eventually 
results in complete failure of the insulation. Overpotential stress occurs 
when a voltage is applied across an insulation greater than its dielectric 
strength. The molecular forces are overwhelmed and the insulation becomes 
a conductor. Some of the causes of insulation failure due to overpotential 
stress are (1) external increase in applied voltage, (2) decrease of insulation 
thickness, and (3) air bubbles or pockets in the insulation.
Example of insulation failure
Let us take an example of an oil-ﬁ lled transformer that has oil and solid paper as 
an insulation system. For the purposes of this example, let us assume that this 
insulation system has 2 in. of oil and 2 in. of paper insulation. Since the dielectric 
constant for both paper and oil is 2.0, we can assume that each insulation system 
can withstand 2500 V/in., giving a total voltage withstand capacity of 10 kV as 
shown in Figure 1.8.

2500 V/in.
FIGURE 1.8

40 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
In order to put contamination in this insulation, let us replace one-tenth 
(1/10) inch of the oil with water and 1 in. of paper insulation with air (i.e., by 
putting voids in the paper as shown in Figure 1.9). Therefore, with the added 
contamination, the 10 kV rated insulation system is now rated at 9.750 kV 
assuming that the air voids do not break down. Since air has a lower dielec-
tric constant, it will take more high-voltage stress than paper as shown in 
Figure 1.9. In this example, the two failure modes may be described in the 
following manner:
Failure due to excessive dielectric loss: The contamination of the oil 
 insulation with water increases the dielectric losses in the oil and 
simultaneously reduces the dielectric strength of the insulation. 
Because of increased losses in the oil insulation over time, it will 
become degraded and eventually fail.
Failure due to overpotential stress: This failure mode occurs when air is 
introduced into the insulation. Air, although a good dielectric at low 
voltages becomes overstressed at higher voltages. It is assumed, in 
this example, that the air voids become overstressed at 2500 V and 
begin ionizing, thus resulting in corona which will eventually dete-
riorate the paper insulation. In this mode, the reduced thickness of 
the insulation and the resulting voltage overstress causes the insula-
tion to fail.
1.7 Insulating Materials for Electrical Power Equipment
There are number of materials which are used either separately or as a com-
bination of composite products to form an insulation system for electrical 
power equipment. The basic materials selected for insulation systems are

Over the years organic insulating materials have been replaced with inor-
ganic materials and this progression is still continuing. There are number of 

42 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
organic and inorganic insulating materials that are used in electric power 
equipment. Although this listing discussed in this section is somewhat long, 
it is not all encompassing because the choices of available insulating materi-
als are many. The use of the trade names in the listing given here does not 
represent a particular brand preference but are included for clarity. The 
 characteristics of various insulating materials are discussed as follows.
Cotton: Cotton has been used extensively in electrical insulation because 
of its low cost, strength, elasticity, fl exibility, and adaptability to size require-
ments and manufacturing process. However, cotton has a tendency to absorb 
moisture and limited thermal capability. Cotton is always used with varnish 
or resin impregnation to obtain good dielectric strength and moisture resis-
tance. The use of cotton is restricted to 105°C (Class A insulation system) 
because temperatures higher than class A cause decomposition of the cotton 
fi bers with resulting embrittlement and loss of mechanical strength.
Cotton fabrics: There are many varieties of treated fabrics that are funda-
mental Class A insulating materials. Untreated cotton fabrics that have been 
thoroughly dried are used for oil transformer insulation. These fabrics are 
quickly impregnated when the transformer is fi lled with oil, thereby  providing 
excellent physical and dielectric properties. Two most commonly used  fabrics 
are tan-varnish treated cloths and black-varnish treated cloths.
Paper: Many types of paper are used in insulating electrical equipment. 
These varieties include Japanese tissues, cotton rags, manila (hemp), the kraft 
(wood pulp), jute, fi shpaper (gray cotton rag), fuller board, and the like. Rag 
and kraft paper often called transformer paper is used to separate windings 
in a transformer or in applications where there are no sharp edges that might 
poke through the relatively weak paper. Fishpaper is usually vulcanized and 
often laminated with Mylar giving it excellent resistance to tear and punc-
ture. The paper–Mylar laminates resist soldering heat better since paper does 
not melt and the Mylar resist moisture best. Papers made with temperature 
resistance nylon and/or glass weaves have excellent electrical properties and 
good temperature resistance. Paper posses similar properties as cotton cloth, 
but because of its structure it has higher dielectric strength than cotton. 
The thermal stability and moisture absorption properties of paper are  similar 
to cotton; however, paper does not possess the high mechanical strength of 
cloth. Untreated paper has little insulating value because of its extreme ten-
dency to absorb moisture.
Asbestos: Recent restriction placed by Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) and OSHA has limited the use of the asbestos as an insulating mate-
rial. It is used in the form of asbestos paper or asbestos tape, asbestos mill 
board or asbestos lumber for electrical insulating purposes. In such forms, it 
may contain 10%–20% wood pulp and glue to give it strength. Asbestos is 
generally heat resistance, but if heated excessively asbestos loses its hygro-
scopic moisture and therefore becomes brittle. Asbestos absorbs moisture 
from the surrounding atmosphere which makes it a less effective insulator.

Glass: Glass insulation comes in a wide variety of forms including solid 
glass, fi ber tapes, fi berglass sheets and mats, woven tubing and cloth, and 
various composites. The most common form of glass used in electrical equip-
ment is fi berglass. Fiberglass is available as fi berglass yarns for insulating 
materials. Today, fi berglass cloths and tapes are widely used in high-
temperature  applications. Two types of fi berglass yarns commonly used for 
 electrical insulation are continuous fi lament and staple fi ber yarns. The con-
tinuous fi lament yarns have the appearance of natural silk or linen whereas 
the staple fi ber yarns exhibit a considerable degree of fuzziness similar to 
wool yarns. Fiberglass has advantages of high thermal endurance, high chem-
ical resistance, high moisture resistance, good tensile strength, and good 
 thermal  conductivity when impregnated or coated with varnish or resin. 
Glass fi bers exhibit poor abrasion resistance therefore fi bers must be lubri-
cated before they are woven into cloth. Varnish treatment of glass cloths 
greatly increases the abrasion resistance. Untreated glass cloth is used pri-
marily as a spacing insulation and when the cloth is impregnated and coated 
with an insulating resin or varnish it becomes an effective dielectric barrier. 
Among the many uses of fi berglass are covering of wire, binder tapes for coils, 
and backing for mica tapes. It is also used as ground insulation and insulation 
for stator coil connections, leads, ring supports, etc. when treated with oleor-
resinous and other varnishes. Fiberglass, varnish-treated fi berglass, and 
 nonwoven forms are thermally stable, resistance to solvent depending on the 
type of varnish used. It is more secure spacer insulation than cotton or paper.
Synthetic textiles and fi lms: Numerous synthetic fi ber textiles are in use 
as electrical insulation. These are either continuous monofi laments of resins, 
or short fi bers made of resins that are spun into threads and woven into  fabrics. 
They have to be coated or impregnated with varnish to become effective 
dielectric barriers. The thermal ability of these materials lies between cellu-
lose fabrics and glass fabrics and depends on the type of resin coating or 
impregnating material used more than their own characteristics. Examples 
of synthetic fi ber cloth and mats are Dacron, other polyesters, aromatic 
nylons, such as Nomex, Kelvar, and others. They have thermal stability, sol-
vent resistance, and lack of fusibility. Several polyester fi lms exhibit excellent 
electrical and physical properties, such as Mylar which enjoys widespread 
use in a variety of insulation systems.
Polyester fi lms: They are used at temperatures above 105°C–125°C and have 
fair solvent resistance. Some specially formulated polyester varieties are 
used for service up to 180°C. The common uses of polyester fi lms such as 
Mylar and others are slot liners, layer insulation in transformers, capacitors, 
and as laminated backing of paper insulation.
Aromatic polyimide (Kapton, Nomex, and others): It is used at temperatures of 
180°C–220°C. It has excellent resistance to solvents and has good heat resis-
tance and superb mechanical and electrical properties. Nomex is a Dupont 
aromatic polyamide with a temperature rating above 220°C and has high 
voltage breakdown strength.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Polyolefi ns: Polypropylene and polyethylene are two known polyolefi ns that 
are available with ultrahigh molecular grade matching the strength of steel. 
Polypropylene is used for insulation not to exceed temperatures above 105°C 
whereas polyethylene fi lm has limited use such as class O insulation system 
since it softens at temperatures higher than 70°C.
Polycarbonate: Common trade names for it are Lexan and Merlon and are 
used for insulation system rated at temperatures 105°C and below. It has 
excellent electrical insulating properties and has good oil resistance but poor 
solvent resistance.
Polysulfone: This is another thermoplastic that include polyetherimide, 
polyamide, and polyphenylene with trade names like Noryl, Udel, Vespel, 
and Torlon. These materials are used at temperatures from 105°C to 130°C 
and have good oil resistance but not chlorinated solvent resistance.
Polytetrafl uoroethylene (Tefl on): It is an excellent high-temperature insulation 
with excellent electrical insulating properties and is used at temperatures of 
220°C and higher. Tefl on tubing and wire insulation is available in a variety 
of colors and typically feels slippery. It has good resistance to moisture.
Nylon: Nylon has good resistance to abrasion, chemicals, and high voltages 
and is often used to fashion electromechanical components. Nylon is 
extruded and cast and is fi lled with a variety of other materials to improve 
weathering, impact resistance, coeffi cient of friction, and stiffness.
Phenolics: Phenolic laminated sheets are usually brown or black and have 
excellent mechanical properties. Phenolics are commonly used in the manu-
facture of switches and similar components because it is easily machined 
and provides excellent insulation. Phenolic laminates are widely used for 
terminal boards, connectors, boxes, and components.
Polyvinylcloride (PVC): PVC is perhaps the most common insulating mate-
rial. Most wiring is insulated with PVC including house wiring. Irradiated 
PVC has superior strength and resistance to heat. PVC tapes and tubing are 
also quite common. Electrical and electronic housings are commonly molded 
from PVC.
Acrylic: Lucite and Plexiglas are trade names for acrylic which has wide-
spread use where toughness and transparency are required.
Beryllium oxide: A hard white ceramic-like material used as an electrical 
insulator where high thermal conductivity is required. Beryllium oxide is 
highly toxic in powder form and should never be fi led or sanded and conse-
quently has fallen out of common use. Power semiconductor heat sinks can 
still be found with beryllium oxide spacers for electrical insulation.
Ceramic: Ceramics are used to fabricate insulators, components, and  circuit 
boards. The good electrical insulating properties are complemented by the 
high thermal conductivity.

Melamine: Melamine laminated with woven glass makes a very hard 
laminate with good dimensional stability and arc resistance. It is used in 
combination with mica to form rigid fi ber laminates.
Mica: Mica sheets or stove mica is used for electrical insulation where high 
temperatures are encountered. Two kinds of mica, Muscovite (white or India 
mica) and phlogopite (amber mica) are generally used for insulating pur-
poses. Mica and reconstituted mica paper are inorganic and infusible. Mica 
has high dielectric strength, high insulation resistance, low dielectric loss, 
good mechanical strength, good dielectric constant (specifi c inductive 
 capacity), and good heat conductivity. Puncture resistance is good but the 
edges of the mica should be fl ush against a fl at surface to prevent fl aking. 
Mica fi nds uses in composite tapes and sheets which are useful up to 600°C 
with  excellent corona resistance. Sheets and rods of mica bonded with glass 
can tolerate extreme temperatures, radiation, high voltage, and moisture. It is 
also available as mica paper where tiny mica fl akes are made into paper like 
structure and reinforced with fi ber, glass, or polyester.
Rigid fi ber laminates: They are made of layers of cloth (glass, cotton, poly-
ester, etc.) or paper with resin (phenolic, melamine, polyester, and epoxy) 
impregnation. They are supplied as thermosetting, thermoforming, and 
postforming materials used as insulators.
Micarta: It is rigid fi ber laminate made of cloth, paper, or wood saturated 
with either a synthetic or organic resin, and then compressed under heat. 
This process makes the resin permanently hard and therefore Micarta becomes 
impermeable to heat, pressure, and solvents. Originally, Micarta was devel-
oped as an insulator but today it has many applications. Micarta is 
 mechanically strong, rigid, and nonmagnetic. It is less susceptible to mois-
ture and most acids. Micarta is used for insulating washers, controller panels 
and cams, slot wedges, brush rigging, bus bar supports, insulating barriers, 
and transformer insulation.
Synthetic resins: Synthetic resins are used extensively in varnish manu-
facture. The polyester and epoxy types are representative of heat hardening 
resins. Varnishes containing such resins are thermosetting and will cure by 
heat alone and do not require oxygen. Other synthetic resins are phenolic 
resins suitable for molding and bonding; alkyd type resins are being substi-
tuted for the old black varnishes and compounds; melamine resins are used 
for making laminates and molded compounds; and vinyl resins are used in 
the compounding of plastics and rubber substitutes.
Varnish: Insulating varnishes are of great importance in the mainte-
nance of electrical equipment and apparatus. An insulating varnish is a 
chemical compound of synthetic resins or varnish gums and drying oils, 
having high dielectric strength and other properties that protect electri-
cal equipment. Varnishes provide important insulating and protective 
functions, which are

Adhesive-coated tapes: Many of the insulating fi lms and fabrics described 
above can be obtained and used with adhesive backing that are usually ther-
moset or heat curable.
Rubber: Natural or Buna S rubber is not normally used for insulation these 
days because it is affected by ozone and has poor thermal stability. On the 
other hand, butyl and ethylene propylene rubbers are ozone resistance and 
more thermally stable. These are used for molded parts, cable insulation, 
and lead insulation in motors.
Silicone rubber: A variety of silicone foam rubbers are available as an 
 insulating material. Silicone rubbers exhibit characteristics of superb chemical 
resistance, high-temperature performance, good thermal and electrical resis-
tance, long-term resiliency, and easy fabrication. Liquid silicone rubbers are 
available in electrical grades for conformal coating, potting, and gluing. 
Silicone rubbers have excellent thermal stability and ozone resistance, but 
only fair mechanical strength and abrasion resistance.
Silicone/fi berglass: Glass cloth impregnated with a silicone resin binder 
makes an excellent laminate with good dielectric loss when dry.
1.7.4 Insulation Temperature Ratings
An insulation system is an assembly of insulating materials in association 
with the conductors and supporting structural parts of an electrical equip-
ment and apparatus. Insulation systems for electrical equipment may be 
classifi ed as solid, liquid, air and vacuum, and gases. The liquid insula-
tion system comprise of mineral oil, silicone, and other less-fl ammable 
fl uids. The gas that is primarily used for electrical insulation is SF6 gas 
known as sulfur hexafl uoride gas. The liquids and gases used as insulat-
ing medium in electrical system and equipment are covered in Chapter 4. 
The air and vacuum insulation system has been used from the very begin-
ning and its characteristics are well documented and understood. 
The  ability of insulating materials or an insulation system to perform its 
intended function is impacted by other aging factors. The major aging 
factors are electrical stresses, mechanical stresses, environmental stresses, 
and thermal stresses. Mechanical stresses imposed upon the system and 
its supporting structure by vibration and differential thermal expansion 
may become of increasing importance as the size of the apparatus 
increases. Electrical stresses will be more signifi cant with high-voltage 

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
47
apparatus or with equipment exposed to voltage transients. Environmental 
stresses will have an impact depending on the presence of moisture, dirt, 
chemicals, radiation, or other contaminants. Thermal stresses depend 
upon environmental conditions (high ambient), loading, and ability to 
dissipate heat. All such factors should be taken into account when select-
ing insulating materials and/or insulation systems. To help the user, IEEE 
Standard 1-2001, “IEEE recommended practice—General principles for 
temperature limits in the rating of electrical equipment and for the evalu-
ation of electrical insulation,” has established the temperature rating for 
solid insulation systems of electrical equipment and apparatus. The IEEE 
Standard 1-2001 takes into account these factors in establishing the stan-
dards of temperature limits for particular classes of apparatus. Thus, for 
temperature rating purposes insulation systems are divided into classes 
according to the thermal endurance of the system.
According to IEEE Standard 1-2000, insulation system classes may be 
 designated by letters and may be defi ned as assemblies of electrical  insulating 
materials in association with equipment parts. These systems may be assigned 
temperature rating based on service experience or on an accepted test proce-
dure that can demonstrate an equivalent life expectancy. The thermal classi-
fi cation of electrical insulating systems established by IEEE Standard 1-2000 
is given in Table 1.2.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
thermal, and environmental stresses occurring in different parts of the structure. 
The level of maintenance required for electrical equipment will depend on the 
effectiveness of the physical support for the insulation, the severity of the forces 
acting on it and the insulating materials themselves, and the service environ-
ment. Therefore, the length of useful life of the insulation depends on the 
arrangement of individual components, their interactions upon one another, 
contribution of each component to the electrical and mechanical integrity of the 
system, and the process used in manufacturing the equipment. Historically, 
functional evaluation of insulation was based primarily on thermal stresses. 
However, with many types of equipment, other aging stresses or factors, such 
as mechanical, electrical, and environmental may be dominant and signifi cantly 
infl uence service life. The  following are the major causes of insulation degrada-
tion and eventual failure.
Mechanical stress: Mechanical stress can be caused by power frequency 
 transient currents such as when switching on power equipment, such as a 
motor or a transformer, that give rise to transient power frequency cur-
rents. In the case of a motor, this transient current may be as high as six 
times the normal frequency current. In the case of a transformer, the 
power frequency current may be as high as 10–12 times the normal cur-
rent. The magnetically induced mechanical forces in the equipment are 
the square of the transient current, therefore a motor experiences mechan-
ical forces 36 or more times and a transformer experiences 100 or more 
times stronger than normal service . If these transient occur frequently, 
such as frequent starting of motors or energizing of transformers and 
these forces cannot be withstood it would eventually lead to mechanical 
damage. Also, insulation can be damaged by mechanical vibration and 
expansion and contraction at power frequency operation. For example, 
when current is applied, the end turns of motor windings are twisted. 
If the twisting force is strong enough to break the bond of insulating var-
nish, the turns of magnetic wire will wear against each other and cause a 
turn-to-turn short. Once the turns are shorted, localized heating is caused 
by the current induced onto the closed loop. This heat rapidly degrades 
the surrounding insulation and over time destroys the groundwall insula-
tion. A similar example may be applied to a transformer inrush current or 
through fault currents that can begin as mechanical damage in the turns 
and eventually manifest as winding faults.
Temperature hot spots: The value of temperature coeffi cient of resistance of an 
insulating material is negative and relatively large. Therefore, even a small 
increase in temperature will cause a large decrease in the insulation resistance. 
The current distribution over a given insulation is not uniform, therefore the 
weak part of the insulation carries more current and heated more than other 
parts, as long as the insulation or adjacent structures can conduct the heat 
away as fast as it is generated, the temperature will remain stable. However, 
if the heat is not dissipated as fast as it is generated the weaker spots in the 
insulation will become increasingly hotter until thermal breakdown occurs.

Maintenance Strategies, Dielectric Theory 
49
Environmental (moisture, chemicals, dirt, and oils): The environmental factors 
that degrade insulation over time are moisture, dirt, dust, oils, acids, and 
alkalies. Moisture is conductive because it contains impurities. When insula-
tion absorbs or is laden with moisture it decreases the insulation resistance. 
The moisture penetrates the cracks and pores of the insulation, especially 
older insulation, and provides low resistance paths for creepage currents 
and potential sources of dielectric failure. Chemical fumes such as acids and 
alkalies often found in the industrial environment directly attack insulation 
and permanently lower its insulation resistance. Similarly, oil fi lms will 
cover the internal surfaces of insulation of a machine. The oil may come from 
the environment or a leaking bearing seal. It will tend to lower the insulation 
resistance, reduce the ability to dissipate heat, and promote thermal aging 
and eventual failure. Dirt and dust in combination with moisture can become 
conductive and therefore cause creepage currents and insulation degrada-
tion as well as reduce the ability of the insulation to dissipate heat. The life of 
equipment is dependent to a considerable extent upon the degree of  exclusion 
of oxygen, moisture, dirt, and chemicals from the interior of the insulating 
structure. At a given temperature, therefore, the life of equipment may be 
longer if the insulation is suitably protected than if it were freely exposed to 
industrial atmospheres.
Electrical stresses (corona, surges, and partial discharges): Electrical equipment 
is always subjected to internally generated or external voltage and current 
surges. A physical rupture of insulation with the destruction of molecular 
bonds might occur during a voltage surge due to switching of a large induc-
tive load or lightning. This transitory overpotential stresses the molecular 
structure of the insulating material causing ionization and failure of the 
insulating material itself. Corona is defi ned as the form of electrical dis-
charge that occurs when the critical (corona inception) voltage is reached, 
thus causing air to breakdown. Corona by itself is not harmful to insulation 
however corona produces ozone which accelerates the oxidation of the 
organic materials of insulation. Further, the nitrogen oxides produced by 
the ionization of air form acids when combined with moisture also degrade 
the insulation. The voids in the cable-extruded insulation once electrifi ed 
begin to conduct and grow larger. This phenomenon is known as partial dis-
charge in the cable insulation and over time makes the void to grow larger and 
eventually cause cable to fail. Electrical stresses will be more signifi cant with 
high-voltage apparatus or with equipment exposed to voltage transients.
Thermal aging: The temperature at which an insulation operates  determines 
its useful life. Thermal stress is the single most recognized cause of insula-
tion degradation. Insulation does not always fail when reaching some criti-
cal temperature, but by gradual mechanical deterioration with time at an 
elevated temperature. The time–temperature relationship determines the 
rate at which the mechanical strength of organic material decreases. 
Thereafter, electrical failure may occur because of physical disintegration 
of the insulating materials. Typical thermal aging mechanisms include 

50 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
(a) loss of volatile constituents, (b) oxidation that can lead to molecular 
cross-linking and embrittlement, (c) hydrolytic degradation in which mois-
ture reacts with the insulation under the infl uence of heat, pressure, and 
other factors to cause molecular deterioration, and (d) chemical breakdown 
of constituents with formation of products that act to degrade the material 
further, such as hydrochloric acid. The electrical and mechanical properties 
of insulating materials and insulation systems may be infl uenced in differ-
ent ways and to different degrees as a function of temperature and with 
thermal aging. Thermal aging progressively decreases elongation to  rupture 
so that embrittlement fi nally leads to cracking and that may contribute to 
electrical failure. Thus, how long insulation is going to last depends not 
only upon the materials used, but also upon the effectiveness of the physi-
cal support for the insulation and the severity of the forces tending to dis-
rupt it. Even though portions of insulation structures may have become 
embrittled under the infl uence of high temperature, successful operation of 
the equipment may continue for years if the insulation is not disturbed. 
Because of the effect of mechanical stress, the forces of thermal expansion 
and contraction may impose temperature limitations on large equipment 
even though higher temperature limits proved satisfactory in small equip-
ment when similar insulating materials were used. The rate of physical 
deterioration of insulation under thermal aging increases rapidly with an 
increase in temperature. The oxidation of the insulating materials is a 
chemical reaction in which the rate of reaction is given by Arrhenius law. 
In his paper, “Electrical insulation deterioration treated as a chemical rate 
phenomenon,” AIEE Transaction, 67 (Part 1) (1948) 113–122, T.W. Dakin real-
ized the relationship between the thermal aging phenomenon and the 
Arrhenius law of chemical reaction rates. The life of insulation is related to 
temperature and can be expressed by

where
LH is life in hours (or the specifi c reaction rate)
A is the frequency of molecular encounters

R is the universal gas constant
T is the absolute temperature (K)
The above equation can be simplifi ed as
 
/

where A and B are constants.
An approximation of the above equation states that life of insulation will 
be reduced by half for every 10°C rise in temperature. From the above equa-
tion, it is apparent that higher the temperature, the shorter the expected life 
of the insulation.

1.8.1 Failure Modes—Electrical Power Equipment
Failures can occur in any electrical equipment at any time. The major power 
equipment considered for discussion are transformers, switchgear breakers, 
switchgear buses, electromechanical relays, cables, and rotating machines. 
The insulation systems makeup of the above referenced equipment contains 
dielectric materials which are the key components for gauging its reliability. 
A failure in insulation, or an insulation system, is failure of the power equip-
ment. Therefore, we will briefl y review the insulation systems of major elec-
trical equipment and apparatus for an understanding why and how power 
equipment fails. A better understanding of the failure modes and effects will 
help broaden the understanding in the care and servicing of electrical power 
equipment.
1.8.1.1 Transformers
Major components that make up a transformer are primary winding, 
 secondary winding, magnetic iron core, coolant (air, gas, oil, or synthetic 
fl uid), bushings, and tank. The insulating materials used in the makeup of 
 transformer insulation system are enameled conductors (wire), kraft paper, 
glass, thermoplastic insulating tape, presswood, glass fabric, wood, resins, 
porcelain, cements, polymer coatings, gasket materials, internal paints, and 
mineral oil or synthetic fl uid. The iron core with its clamping structure, the 
primary and secondary windings with their clamping arrangement, and 
leads and tapping from windings together with their supporting structure 
complete the construction components of a transformer. Insulating materials 
used in the manufacturing of bushing are porcelain, glass, thermosetting 
cast resins, paper tape, and oil. The paper used in bushing is usually oil- 
impregnated paper, resin-impregnated paper, or resin-bonded paper. 
The feed-through lead conductor with its insulation system is enclosed in 
porcelain or glass housing. Bushings are constructed as condenser bushing 
or noncondenser bushing (see Section 3.6.2 for more detail). The condenser 
bushings are used in transformers with primary voltage rating above 50 kV 
whereas the noncondenser type bushings are used below 50 kV applications.
Transformer failures, while infrequent, are usually the culmination of a 
series of events: unusual loading, impressed surges (from protective circuitry 
failure or local switching), or improper maintenance. Nearly always, incipi-
ent failures can be determined by testing, and PM performed to correct the 
condition. If, however, the transformer does fault, other connected or adja-
cent equipment is protected by the sensing elements and circuit breakers. 
Any fl uid spill or fi re activates the fi re extinguishing system if installed. 
There is very little probability that even a major transformer fault will 
mechanically damage any equipment other than itself. The mechanical 
damage will largely be confi ned to nearby piping, support structures, or 
electrical connections. The possible spill of fl aming transformer oil into 
a trench carrying either oil-fi lled cables, hydrogen supply lines, or the 
 transformer oil-fi ltering piping could easily involve areas and elements of 

52 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
equipment not electrical in nature. There is, of course, a small chance that 
projectiles from the bushings could impact on ceramic supports or feed 
through of other nearby equipment and contribute to their failure. If the 
transformer fault involves arcing between the high- and low-voltage wind-
ings, the physical damage resulting from the fault may well extend into the 
low-voltage bus work and connections.
Table 1.3 displays results of Harford Steam Boiler Insurance Company (HSB) 
1998 study on the causes of transformer failures. Table 1.4 displays the results 
of HSB 2003 study on distribution of transformer failures. For the causes of 
failures reported line surge/through faults are the number one cause for all 
types of failures. Insulation failure was the second leading cause of trans-
former failures and these failures were attributed to defective installation,

insulation deterioration, and short circuits. For failures due to aging, the 
winding insulation looses mechanical and dielectric withstand strength over 
time and therefore is weakened to the point where it can no longer sustain the 
high radial and compressive forces induced by a line surge, or an internal or 
through fault. Also, as the load increases due to system expansion, the operat-
ing stresses increase in a transformer.
Large power transformers used in the medium-voltage electrical distribu-
tion system are typically of liquid-immersed type. The primary and  secondary 
coils are immersed in oil, which acts to insulate as well as cool the coils. 
The coils are wrapped on an iron core, which is enclosed in a tank and fi lled 
with oil. A dedicated cooling system consisting of fi nned radiators with 
 temperature-controlled cooling fans will be provided to remove heat from the 
internals. In addition, some cooling systems include one or more circulating 
pumps to increase the fl ow of oil through the heat exchanger and provide 
more effi cient core cooling. The insulating oil is circulated through the trans-
former tank and heat is rejected via the heat exchanger. The power for the 
 circulating pumps and cooling fans is typically 480 V AC. Smaller power 
transformers, such as those found in load center switchgear, may be either oil-
fi lled or dry-type units. Dry-type transformers may be air-cooled with natural 
circulation alone, or more typically, forced-air-cooled with temperature- 
controlled cooling fans. Power connections to electrical buses and cables are 
routed through insulated bushings to the interior transformer windings.
Age-related degradation of transformers is primarily associated with the 
coils and the electrical connections. Degradation of the coils can occur due to 
continual exposure to elevated temperature, or degradation of the insulating 
oil. When the oil starts to degrade, gas is generated, which will accumulate 
inside the transformer tank. Checking for gas content in the oil is one method 
of transformer condition monitoring. Moisture intrusion is also a concern 
since entrained moisture can cause the formation of bubbles in the insulat-
ing oil during transformer operation. Formation of bubbles can degrade the 
performance of the transformer. Some examples of failure causes of power 
transformers are the following:
Short circuit to ground
• 
Turn-to-turn short
• 
Primary to secondary short
• 
External oil leakage
• 
Degraded or inoperable cooling system (reduces transformer million 
• 
volt amperes (MVA) rating)
To develop and implement a rigorous PM program, an understanding of trans-
former failure modes is necessary. The transformers can fail from any combi-
nation of electrical, mechanical, and thermal factors. Actual transformer 
failures as listed above involve breakdown of the insulation system which may 
result from any of the factors (failure modes) just mentioned above. Table 1.5 
summarizes the stressors, failure modes and effects of power transformers.

Transformers
5.1 Introduction
This chapter covers information on the maintenance and testing of power 
transformers. To ensure trouble-free service over the life of the transformer, 
it has to be maintained regularly, but equally important it must be operated 
properly. Therefore this chapter provides information on the basic design, 
construction, application, and operation of power distribution transformers 
with the expectation that this information will help toward better care and 
maintenance of transformers.
A transformer is an energy transformation device that transforms alternating 
current (AC) or voltage at one level to AC and voltage at another level. A trans-
former can economically convert voltage or current from low to high levels, 
or from high to low levels. The transformer usually consists of two or more 
insulated windings on a common iron core. In industrial and  commercial appli-
cations, transformers are used to step down voltages from utility service voltage 
to lower distribution voltage levels or lower utilization voltages that may be 
required for a facility or a plant. Transformers are very reliable devices and can 
provide service for a long time if maintained and serviced regularly. Transformer 
failures, when they occur, are usually of a very  serious nature, which may require 
costly repairs and long downtime. The best insurance against transformer 
failure is to ensure that they are properly installed and maintained.
5.2 Transformer Categories and Type
For consideration of maintenance requirements, transformers can be divided 
into the following categories:
Insulating medium

Application and use
5.2.1 Insulating Medium
The transformer’s insulating medium can be subdivided into two types: dry 
and liquid fi lled.

10.4.5 Horsepower, Torque, and Speed Considerations
The horsepower of a motor can be defi ned as the capability of the motor to 
do a given amount of work. Motors are rated as fractional or integral 
horsepower. The torque of a motor can be defi ned as the turning force 
developed by the motor, or it can be referred to as the resistance offered to 
the turning force by the driven load. Usually, torque for motors is expressed 
in terms of percentage of rated full-load torque. The speed of the motor is 
expressed as rpm, that is, a rate of measure of motion. The several defi ni-
tive speed terms (as outlined in the section on the classifi cation of motors 
according to variability of speed) that are common to all motors are stan-
dardized in order to relate the delivery of torque at a given speed for pur-
poses of application. For AC motors the synchronous speed can be 
calculated as

Induction motors, however, operate at actual speeds that are less than the 
synchronous speed because of losses in the motor. The difference between 
synchronous and actual speed is knows as slip. Slip is usually expressed as 
a percentage of synchronous speed and can be calculated as
 
Slip (%)

The horsepower of the motor can be stated in mechanical or electrical terms. 
One horsepower (1 hp) is equal to 33,000 ft. lb/min. The torque produced by 
an electric motor can be calculated as

A typical torque–speed curve for a motor is shown in Figure 10.5. The  various 
NEMA design motor torque–speed curves are shown in Figure 10.6.
In order to apply motors, the fi rst thing to determine is the desired full-
load speed and the desired horsepower at that speed. Other factors required 
when applying motors are type of torque required by the load and the start-
ing current limitations. Motor torque characteristics must match those of the 
load from starting to the time when the motor reaches its rated speed. 
The motor must develop net accelerating torque for every point on the load 
curve in order to reach its actual speed.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
To understand the torques developed by the various motors, the following 
defi nitions are given; they are shown in Figure 10.5 for each design type of 
motor.
Lock-rotor torque (starting torque):
• 
 The minimum torque developed 
by the motor for all angular positions of the rotor when the primary 
winding (stator winding) is energized with AC power supply.
Accelerating torque:
• 
 The torque developed with rated power input 
during the period from standstill to full speed. This is the net  positive 
torque available to the motor beyond the torque required by the load.

Breakdown torque (maximum torque):
• 
 The maximum torque developed 
by the motor at rated power input without an abrupt change in speed.
Pull-out torque:
• 
 The maximum torque developed by a motor for 1 min 
without stalling. It is frequently referred to as the breakdown torque.
Pull-in torque:
• 
 The torque developed during the transition from 
rated speed (slip speed) to synchronous speed.
Pull-up torque:
• 
 The minimum torque developed with rated power 
input during the period of acceleration from standstill to rated speed.
Full-load torque:
• 
 The torque developed at rated speed with rated 
power input.
Torque characteristics of various motors can best be described by comparing 
one motor type with another. Torques are classifi ed as very high, high, 
medium, low, and very low. The torque–speed curves for the various NEMA 
motor designs as listed under classifi cation according to application shown 
in Figure 10.6.
10.4.6 Power Factor
The connected motor load in a facility is usually a major factor in  determining 
the system PF. Low system PF results in increased losses in the distribution 
system. Induction motors inherently cause a lagging system PF and, under 
certain circumstances, they can cause a very low system PF.
The PF of an induction motor decreases as the load decreases. When the 
load on the motor is increased, the rated load PF increases; that is, a fully 
loaded motor has a higher PF. Several induction motors, all operating 
at light load, can cause the electrical system to have a low PF. The PF of induc-
tion motors at rated load is less for low-speed than for high-speed motors.
A small increase in voltage (10%) above rated voltage will decrease the PF, 
and a small decrease in voltage (10%) below rated voltage will improve the 
PF of an induction motor. However, other performance characteristics may 
be adversely affected by such a change in voltage. Therefore, operation as 
close as possible to the nameplate voltage and horsepower ratings is 
recommended.
The PF of synchronous motors can range from 1.0 to approximately 0 PF 
leading, depending on the rated PF and the load for which they are built. 
Standard designs are usually rated for unity, 0.8 lagging, or 0.8 leading PF. 
As previously stated, synchronous motors have the capability of improving 
the PF of the electrical system.
10.4.7 Motor Selection
Induction motor: The selection of the induction motor depends on the 
 performance characteristics of the driven machine, and these, in turn, 
 determine the operating characteristics of the motor. Some machines, such as 

568 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
most fans, blowers, centrifugal pumps, and unloaded compressors, require a 
relatively low starting torque. After starting, the required driving torque 
increases with increasing speed up to the full-load speed and torque. A design B 
motor is frequently selected to drive this type of application.
Other machines, such as reciprocating air compressors and loaded 
 conveyors, require high starting torque. The torque needed to start the 
machine is sometimes greater than the torque required at full-load speed. 
A design C motor is frequently selected to drive this type of application. For 
driven machines that impose pulsating loads or require frequent starting of 
the motor, such as punch press and well pumping, and hoist applications, 
a design D is often used.
Synchronous motors: In general, large synchronous motors can be applied to 
any load that induction motors with design B or C characteristics can handle. 
They have a higher effi ciency than an induction motor of the equivalent 
rating and are capable of improving the system PF. When effi ciency is a 
 primary consideration in choosing a relatively large motor, a 1.0 PF synchro-
nous motor may provide the solution. Where system PF improvement is a 
primary consideration, the use of a 0.8 leading PF synchronous motor may 
provide the solution.
Multispeed motors: Multispeed motors can be designed to have speed–torque 
characteristics similar to those of design A, B, C, or D motors of the equiva-
lent rating. They can be designed for variable torque, constant torque, or 
constant horsepower. For the highest effi ciency, it is important to select the 
correct multispeed motor characteristic for the load at all operating speeds. 
Typical examples of variable-torque loads are fans and centrifugal pumps. 
Constant-torque motors are used to drive apparatus such as conveyors, posi-
tive displacement pumps, and compressors. Machine tools and winches are 
examples of drives requiring the use of constant-horsepower motors.
10.5 AC Generators
Application criteria for AC generators are discussed next.
10.5.1 Service Conditions
Ac generators, like AC motors, should be correctly selected with respect to their 
service conditions. The usual and unusual conditions are the same for genera-
tor applications as those listed for AC motors. Some generators may operate in 
accordance with their ratings under one or more unusual service conditions. 
However, where some unusual service condition exists, a special-purpose gen-
erator may be required. Even though in such cases past experience may be the 
best guide in selecting the machine, it is recommended that the manufacturer 
be consulted concerning the mechanical and thermal duty of the machine.

Motors and Generators 
569
10.5.2 Ratings
The continuous basis of rating synchronous generators is in kilowatts (kW) 
or kilovolt-amperes (kVA) at 80% PF. The ratings of kVA, speed, voltage, 
frequency, and so on, are expressed in NEMA MG1 standards for three-phase 
and single-phase machines. The excitation voltages for the fi eld windings are 
also stated in the same NEMA standards; they are 62.5, 125, 375, and 500 V 
DC. These excitation voltages apply to machines with brushes only. 
Synchronous generators are capable of carrying a 1 min overload of 50% of 
normal rated current with the fi eld set at normal rated load excitation. A syn-
chronous generator is designed to withstand three-phase short-circuit cur-
rent at its terminal for 30 s operating at rated kVA and PF, at 5% overvoltage 
with fi xed excitation. The phase current due to faults other than three-phase 
faults must be limited by external means to a value that does not exceed 
the maximum phase currents obtained from three-phase fault.
The kW output of the machine depends upon the voltage, armature cur-
rent, and PF. Also, the synchronous generator kVA ratings may be stated at 
defi nite voltage and frequency. The permissible load output of the synchro-
nous generator depends upon the balance of the load. It is maximum for 
balanced loads and minimum for single-phase loads.
10.5.3 Temperature Rise
The temperature rise under rated load conditions for synchronous generators 
is based on the insulation system used for the machines. The  temperature rise 
is determined in accordance with the latest IEEE std 115-1995, IEEE guide: 
Test Procedures for Synchronous Machines. The method of temperature determi-
nation may be resistance or embedded resistance temperature  detector (RTD). 
Table 10.4 lists the various temperature rises for the various generator sizes 
and insulation systems.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
The standard ambient temperature is taken as 40°C, and where the  ambient 
temperature is higher than the standard, it is recommended that the 
 temperature rise of generators be reduced as follows:
For increases in ambient temperature above 40°C up to and  including 
• 
50°C, decrease the temperature rise by 10°C
For increases in ambient temperature above 50°C up to and  including 
• 
60°C, decrease the temperature rise by 20°C
10.5.4 Variation in Voltage
Synchronous generators can operate at rated kVA, frequency, and PF at 
 voltages above and below the rated voltage not to exceed 5%. The maximum 
voltage any synchronous generator can produce at a defi nite frequency 
depends upon the permissible pole fl ux and fi eld heating. To maintain a 
rated voltage output, specifi c fi eld excitation is necessary at some specifi ed 
load and PF.
10.5.5 Regulation
Regulation of a synchronous generator at any given PF is defi ned as a 
 percentage rise in voltage, a constant frequency at excitation, when rated kVA 
load is removed. The regulation depends upon armature reactance, arma-
ture effective resistance, change in leakage fl ux with change in load, and 
 armature reaction.
10.6 DC Motors
Application criteria for DC motors are discussed next.
10.6.1 Service Conditions
Similar to AC motors, the DC motors should be selected with regard to their 
environmental conditions. The service conditions may be usual or unusual 
and may involve environmental as well as operating conditions. The service 
conditions listed for AC motors also apply to the application of DC motors.
10.6.2 Operation of DC Motor on Rectified AC
The performance of a DC motor operating on rectifi ed AC is different than if 
it were operating on a DC source having the same effective value of voltage. 
The reason for this is due to the continuous ripple or pulsation of the output 
voltage from the rectifi ed AC voltage source. The ripple effect appears in the 

Motors and Generators 
571
motor armature current and thus affects its performance. The effect of the 
rectifi ed voltage on the motor armature current becomes signifi cant when 
the rectifi er pulse number is less than 6 or the amount of phase control is 
more than 15%. Also, when a DC motor is operated from an unfi ltered recti-
fi er power supply, bearing currents may result. Ripple currents may fl ow to 
ground by means of capacitive coupling between rotor winding and core. 
Even though these currents are small in magnitude, they may cause damage 
to antifriction and sleeve bearings under certain circumstances. Measures 
should be taken to minimize these currents to avoid damage to the motor.
10.6.3 Operation of the DC Motor below Base Speed
When a DC motor is operated below base speed by means of reduced 
 armature voltage, the motor will heat up if rated full-load torque is main-
tained. To avoid overheating of the motor, reduce the load to compensate for 
the overheating of the motor. The speed of the DC motor is directly 
 proportional to the armature voltage, and the torque is directly proportional 
to the armature current. Overheating can result due to the insuffi cient heat 
dissipating ability of the motor at these speeds.
10.6.4 Operation of the DC Motor above Base Speed
DC motors are built so that in case of an emergency they can withstand an 
overspeed of 25% above rated full-load speed without mechanical injury.
10.6.5 Overload Capability
The general industrial motors of open, forced ventilation, and totally enclosed 
water–air-cooled types are capable of carrying, with successful commuta-
tion, 115% of rated horsepower load continuously at rated voltage through-
out their speed range. Refer to NEMA standard MG1, Sections 23.10, 23.11, 
and 23.28 for overload capability, momentary load capability, and rate of 
change of load current, respectively, on these types of motors.
10.7 DC Generators
Application criteria for DC generators are discussed next.
10.7.1 Service Conditions
The DC generators should be correctly selected with respect to their service 
conditions. These conditions may be usual or unusual, involving  environmental 
and operating conditions. The typical service conditions that have been listed 
under Section 10.4 also apply to DC generators.

572 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
10.7.2 Ratings
The DC generators are classifi ed into industrial DC and other DC integral-
horsepower generators and large-apparatus DC generators (larger than 
0.6 kW/rpm) of open type. The industrial generator ratings range from 0.75 
to 720 kW, speeds range from 720 to 3450 rpm, and voltages range from 125 to 
500 V. The large-apparatus DC generator ratings range from 125 to 6400 kW, 
speeds range from 200 to 900 rpm, and voltages range from 250 to 700 V. Refer 
to NEMA standards MG1, Section II, Part 15 and MG1, Section III, Part 24 for 
specifi c information on generator size, speed, and voltage ratings.
10.7.3 Temperature Rise
The temperature rise of DC generators under rated load conditions is 
 dependent on the type of insulation system and enclosure used for the 
 various parts of the machine. Either the thermometer or the resistance method 
is used for the measurement of temperature rise. Refer to NEMA standards 
MG1, Section II, Part 15 and MG1, Section III, Part 24 for specifi c information 
on temperature rise for the two types of generators.
10.7.4 Overload Capability
Industrial-type generators are capable of carrying overload for 1 min, with 
successful commutation loads of 150% of the continuous rated load amperes 
at rated load excitation. Large-apparatus DC generators of open type are 
capable of carrying 115% of rated current for 2 h and 200% of rated current 
for 1 min at rated speed and rated or less than rated voltage.
10.7.5 Voltage Excitation
Large-apparatus DC generators, when operated at less than rated voltage, 
shall carry currents equal to those corresponding to their kilowatt and voltage 
ratings. The load voltage at rated load of a self-excited, fl at, compound-wound, 
drip-proof industrial generator, rated at 50 kW and smaller and employing 
class B insulation, shall not exceed 112% of the rated voltage at rated load.
10.7.6 Overspeed
DC generators are constructed so that, in an emergency, they will withstand 
overspeed of 25% without mechanical injury.
10.8 Motor and Generator Insulation Systems
10.8.1 Machine Insulation System
Insulation is obviously a limiting factor in the design of an electrical machine. 
If the thickness of the insulation is increased, the space available for the  current 
carrying conductor is reduced and the conduction of heat from the conductor 

Motors and Generators 
573
to the iron is restricted. Requirements of an insulation system for machine 
stator windings are
 
1. High dielectric strength
 
2. High resistance to partial discharges (PD)
 
3. High thermal conductivity
 
4. Good resistance to abrasions
 
5. Good resistance to tape separation caused by thermal heating
 
6. Good resistance to moisture and oil vapor
Machine insulation system is made up of fi ve major insulation subsystems as 
discussed below.
Turn-to-turn insulation system: Turn-to-turn insulation is located 
between separate wires in each coil. This is usually in the form of an 
enamel coating on the wire. Glass over enamel is used on severe 
applications both for formed and random-wound coils.
Phase-to-phase insulation system: Phase-to-phase insulation is located 
between adjacent coils in different phase groups.
Phase-to-ground insulation system: Phase-to-ground insulation is located 
between windings, as well as between windings and the ground or 
 structural parts of the motor. A sheet material such as the liner used 
in stator slots  provides both dielectric and mechanical protection.
Slot wedge insulation system: Slot wedge which holds conductors fi rmly 
in the slots is referred to as slot wedge insulation.
Impregnation insulation system: Impregnation is used to bind all of the 
other components together and to fi ll in the air spaces. A total 
impregnation applied in a fl uid form and hardened, provides pro-
tection against contaminants.
The various insulation systems that make up the machine insulation system are 
shown in Figure 10.7. Refer to Section 1.7 in Chapter 1 for additional informa-
tion on insulating materials used for electrical equipment. The insulation sys-
tems used for machine windings are classifi ed by NEMA and are listed below:
Class O: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 100°C. It is 
made of materials or combinations of materials such as cotton, silk, 
and paper without impregnation.
Class A: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 105°C. It is 
made of materials or combinations of materials such as cotton, silk, 
and paper when suitably impregnated or coated or when immersed 
in a dielectric liquid such as oil.
Class B: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 130°C. 
It is made of materials or combinations of materials such as mica, 

574 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
glass fi ber, asbestos, etc., with suitable bonding substances capable 
of operation at 130°C.
Class F: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 155°C. It is 
made of materials or combinations of materials such as mica, glass 
fi ber, asbestos, etc., with suitable bonding substances capable of 
operation at 155°C.
Class H: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 180°C. It is 
made of materials or combinations of materials such as silicone elas-
tomer, mica, glass fi ber, asbestos, etc., with suitable bonding sub-
stances such as appropriate silicone resins and other materials 
capable of operation at 180°C.
Class C: This insulation is rated for a total temperature of 220°C. It is 
made of materials or combinations of materials such as Tefl on and 
other natural or synthetic materials capable of operation at 220°C.
The industry standards, such as IEEE standards 112 and NEMA MG1 describe 
methods of temperature-rise measurements in rotating machinery. They are 
(1) measurements by thermometer and (2) resistance methods. Briefl y, 
the resistance method is based upon the ambient and the total temperature 
rise, which is shown in Figure 10.8b. The thermometer method is based on 
four factors: (1) the standard ambient temperature of 40°C, (2) a service factor, 
(3) the measured temperature rise, and (4) the allowable hot spot. This is 
shown in Figure 10.8a. The various insulation systems normally used for 
machines are shown in Table 10.5.
The temperature determined by the resistance method gives an indication 
of the average total temperature of the motor windings. The life of the  insulation 
system is dependent on both the temperature rise and the total temperature of 
the motor windings. The total temperature for the various insulation classes is 
shown in Table 10.5. The motor temperature measurement by resistance

method takes into consideration only two factors: the ambient temperature 
and the temperature rise measured by resistance at service-factor load. The 
sum of these two temperatures makes up the basis of total temperature of the 
insulation system. The resistance method eliminates the consideration of hot 
spot allowance, the 10°C allowance for service factor, and temperature rise 
measured by thermometer at nameplate load. Under the resistance method, 
the insulation system needed for the motor can simply be specifi ed in terms of 
the operating ambient temperature and the service factor of the motor.
The use of the resistance method for the measurement of insulation 
 temperature does not change the limitation imposed on the various classes 
of insulation systems. The resistance method has simplifi ed the specifi cation

b The hot spot allowance is a temperature allowance for the difference between the 
measured  temperature rise of the winding and the estimated hottest location in the wind-
ing. This number varies from 5°C to 25°C with measured rise, enclosure, and temperature 
measurement method.

of the insulation temperature rating system for machine windings. As a 
result of this change in the temperature measurement method, the class B 
insulation system has been adopted as a standard for motor windings.
10.9 Motor and Generator Maintenance
This section deals with the inspection and maintenance of motors and 
 generators of all sizes except steam and gas turbines. To obtain maximum effi -
ciency and reliability of motors and generators, they have to be operated and 
maintained correctly. When motors and generators are maintained, many pre-
cautions must be followed to avoid damage. Usually this damage results from 
maintenance personnel lacking thorough knowledge of motor design, con-
struction, application, and correct maintenance. The purpose of this section is 
to provide general maintenance and failure mechanism information common 
to most types of motors and generators. The information is divided into sev-
eral subsections; the fi rst two sections provide information on the  failure 
mechanism and overall general inspection for all types of machines. Also, the 
reader should refer to Section 1.8 in Chapter 1 for additional  information on 
causes of insulation degradation and failure modes of motors. The remaining 
sections deal with particular types of machines and components.
10.9.1 Failure Mechanisms
The failure mechanisms of the machine are divided into stator winding, 
rotor winding, and exciter. These are discussed in Sections 10.9.1.1, 10.9.1.2, 
and 10.9.1.3.
10.9.1.1 Stator-Winding Insulation
The failure mechanisms of stator winding are (1) age deterioration, (2) elec-
trical cause, (3) mechanical causes, (4) thermal causes, and (5) environmental 
contamination.
The age-related deterioration causes brittleness, shrinkage, and cracks in 
insulation. The electrical causes are corona, slot discharge, lightning, 
 switching surges, single-phasing, unbalance voltages, overheating effects, 
and test failures. The single phasing and voltage unbalance can be caused by 
either problems in the utility distribution system or the in-plant distribution 
system. Voltage unbalance causes negative sequence currents, which cause 
 overheating of the remaining phase windings and the stator. The negative 
sequence  currents also cause rotor overheating, which in turn causes stator 
induced currents that can lead to stator-winding failure. Rotor heating may 
result in rotor vibration and shaft/bearing overheating, which can result in 
machine-bearing failure. Similarly, the overloading problems can be caused 
by low voltage on the incoming utility line supplying the plant or facility,

are stator-winding overheating, mechanical stresses on winding end turns 
and individual coils. This in turn results in deterioration of the turn-to-turn, 
coil-to-coil, phase-to-phase, and coil-to-ground insulation. The mechanical 
causes are vibration, loose ties and wedges, broken amortisseur bars, fan 
blades, loose iron, loose connections, close-in, or out-of-step synchronizing, 
and foreign objects. The thermal causes are overloading, overheating from 
short-circuited laminations, thermal cycling, loss of cooling, overheating 
from failure of strand insulation, and tape separation. The environmental 
and contamination causes are conducting dust or particles, moisture, oil, and 
magnetic particles.
10.9.1.2 Rotor-Winding Insulation
The failure mechanisms of rotor insulation are (1) age deterioration, (2)  electrical 
causes, (3) mechanical causes, (4) thermal causes, and (5) environmental 
contamination.
The age deterioration causes are the same as discussed for the stator. The 
electrical causes are starting transients, switching surges, and high voltage 
induced from the stator faults. The mechanical causes are vibrations, high 
resistance connections, cracked or broken lead support insulators, collar 
deterioration, broken amortisseur bars, close-in unbalanced faults, broken 
banding wire, and loose mechanical parts. The thermal causes are excessive 
fi eld current, loss of cooling and unbalanced faults. The environmental 
 factors are moisture, bridging of magnetic pole gaps, or groups of energized 
parts by foreign objects or conductive dust.
10.9.1.3 Exciter Insulation
The failure mechanisms of exciter insulation are age deterioration, electrical 
causes, mechanical causes, thermal causes, and environmental contamina-
tion as discussed under stator and rotor insulation.
10.9.2 General Inspection
The fundamental justifi cation for the inspection and maintenance of motors 
and generators is to prevent service interruptions resulting from equipment 
failure. A defi nite program of inspection and maintenance should be 
 organized so that all apparatus is assured of attention at stated periods; these 
periods should be adjusted to meet the actual need that experience over a 
number of years as indicated is necessary. To assure adequate inspection, it 
is essential that an inspection record be kept for each piece of apparatus.
Maintenance should be supplemented by visual inspection of all areas that 
experience has shown to be vulnerable to damage or degradation. Obviously, 
this necessitates scheduling disassembly of the apparatus at the time the 
electrical tests are made. Following is a general maintenance guide that is 
applicable to all motors and generators.

578 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
10.9.2.1 Visual Inspection
The most signifi cant parts on which inspection should be made are the 
(1) armature (or stator) windings, (2) fi eld winding (or rotor), (3) brush  rigging 
and collector rings or commutator surfaces.
Armature windings
Check for the following signs of deterioration:
Deterioration or degradation of insulation resulting from thermal 
• 
aging. Examination of coils might reveal general puffi ness, swell-
ing into ventilation ducts, or a lack of fi rmness of the insulation, 
suggesting a loss of bond with consequent separation of the insu-
lation layers from themselves or from the winding conductors 
or turns.
Girth cracking or separation of the ground wall from wound coils. 
• 
This is most likely to occur on long stator coil having asphaltic-type 
bonds. Particular attention should be paid to the areas immediately 
adjacent to the ends of the slots. Where considerable cracking is 
observed, it is recommended that the wedges at the ends of the slots 
be removed, as dangerous cracks may also have occurred just within 
the slots.
Contamination of coil and connection surfaces by substances that 
• 
adversely affect insulation strength, the most common being carbon 
dust, oil, and moisture contamination.
Abrasion or contamination of coil and connection surfaces from 
• 
other sources, such as chemicals and abrasive or conducting sub-
stances. Such effects are aggravated in the case of motors used in 
adverse atmospheric industrial applications, such as chemical plants, 
rubber mills, and paper manufacturing facilities, and wastewater 
treatment installations.
Cracking or abrasion of insulation resulting from prolonged or 
• 
abnormal mechanical stresses. In stator windings, looseness of the 
bracing structure is a certain guide to such phenomena and can itself 
cause further mechanical damage if allowed to go unchecked.
Eroding effects of foreign substances embedded or lodged against 
• 
coil insulation surfaces. Particularly damaging are magnetic particles 
that vibrate with the effects of the magnetic fi eld in the machine.
Insulation deterioration due to corona discharges in the body of the 
• 
medium voltage machine or end windings. These are evidenced by 
white, gray, or red deposits and are particularly noticeable in areas 
where the  insulation is subject to high electrical stresses. Some expe-
rience is required to distinguish these effects from powdering, 
which can occur as a result of relative vibratory movement between 
hard  surfaces and which can be caused by loose end-winding 
structures.

Motors and Generators 
579
Loose slot wedges or slot fi llers that, if allowed to go uncorrected, 
• 
may themselves cause mechanical damage or reduce the  effectiveness 
of stator coil retention against short-circuit and other abnormal 
mechanical forces.
Effects of overspeeding may be observed on DC armatures by 
• 
 distortion of the windings or commutator rises, looseness or  cracking 
of the banding, or movement of slot wedges.
Commutators should be checked for uneven discoloration, which 
• 
can result from short-circuiting of bars, or for pinholes and burrs 
resulting from fl ashover.
Risers (connections between commutator bars and coils in slots) may 
• 
collect carbon deposits and cause electrical leakage and subsequent 
failure.
Field windings
In addition to insulation degradation from causes similar to those listed 
under armature windings, close attention should be paid to the following in 
fi eld windings:
Distortion of coils due to the effects of abnormal mechanical,  electrical, 
• 
or thermal forces. Such distortions might cause failure between turns 
or to ground.
Shrinkage or looseness of fi eld-coil washers. This permits coil 
• 
 movement during periods of acceleration and deceleration, with the 
probability of abrading turn insulation, and breaking or loosening 
of connections between coils.
Breakage or distortion of damper bars due to overspeed or abnormal 
• 
thermal gradients between bars and the connecting end ring. Such 
breaks are often diffi cult to observe in machines that have operated in 
contaminated conditions and usually occur near the end ring or at the 
end of the pole piece. Low-resistance measurements between bar and 
end ring by means of a micro-ohmmeter, or digital low resistance 
ohmmeter, or similar instrument provides a means of detection.
Loose damper bars with related burning of the tips of the pole-piece 
• 
laminations. Among other cases, this could occur as a result of i ncorrect 
swaging or other means of retention of the bar during manufacture.
In cylindrical-pole (or round motor) windings, evidence of heating of 
• 
wedges at their contact with the retaining-ring body and  half-mooning 
or cracks on the retaining rings can be caused by high circulating 
currents due to unbalanced operation or sustained single-phase 
faults close to the generator, such as in the leads or generator bus.
Condition and tightness of end-winding blocking, signs of  movement 
• 
of the retaining-ring insulating liner, and any other looseness should 
be noted.

580 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Powered insulation in air ducts is evidence of coil movement. Red 
• 
oxide at metallic joints is evidence of metal parts.
Check tightness of fi eld lead connections and condition of collector 
• 
lead insulation.
Brush rigging
Brush rigging should be checked for evidence of fl ashover.
• 
Before disassembly, the brush boxes should be checked to ensure 
• 
that the clearance from the collector or commutator surface is in line 
with the manufacturer’s recommendations. They should be checked 
to see whether the brushes are free riding and that excessive carbon 
buildup is not present.
Brushes themselves should be checked to see whether any excessive 
• 
edge chipping, grooving, or double facing is evident.
Brush connections should also be checked.
• 
Voltage checks
Unbalanced voltage or single-phase operation of polyphase machines 
• 
may cause excessive heating and ultimate failure. It requires only a 
slight unbalance of voltage applied to a polyphase machine to cause 
large unbalanced currents and resultant overheating. In such cases, 
the power supply should be checked and rectifi ed if even the slight-
est unbalance is found.
Single-phase power applied to a three-phase motor will also cause 
• 
excessive heating from failure to start or from unbalanced currents.
Unbalanced currents may also be caused by attempts to operate 
• 
machines having one or more coils disconnected or cut out of one or 
more phases. If the unbalance is appreciable, the machine should be 
rewound.
10.9.3  DC Motors and Generators 
and Repulsion-Induction Motors
The following recommendations are given for DC motors; they also apply to 
repulsion-induction motors used on AC circuits.
10.9.3.1 Cleanliness
One of the principal causes of malfunction and eventual failure in DC and 
repulsion-induction rotating equipment is dirt, either from an accumulation 
of day-to-day dust or from contamination by particles from nearby  machinery, 
such as metallic dust, lint, oil vapors, and chemicals. This is particularly true 
of this type of electrical apparatus because of its commutators, brushes, and 

Motors and Generators 
581
brush rigging, which can become fouled with dirt, resulting in  unsatisfactory 
performance, arcing, and subsequent burning.
The electrical conductors in all electrical equipment are separated from the 
mechanical components by insulation. Insulation is used on coils to isolate 
individual turns and to separate the coils from the core. Insulation is used in 
commutators to separate the bars from each other and, on the brush rigging, 
to isolate it from the frame or end bracket. Here again, the importance of 
cleanliness must be stressed since electrical insulation materials are noncon-
ducting only when clean and dry. Accumulations of dust and dirt not only 
contribute to insulation breakdown but they operate to increase temperature 
through the restriction of ventilation and by blocking the dissipation of heat 
from the winding and frame surfaces.
10.9.3.2 Armature
The armature is the heart of the DC motor. The line current fl ows through 
the armature and, if the machine is overloaded, it is the fi rst  component to 
show evidence of damage. If given reasonable attention by scheduled peri-
odic inspection and cleaning, it should give little or no trouble if the unit is 
operated within its normal rating. Repairs should be entrusted only to a 
competent entity.
When the armature is removed from the frame for either maintenance or 
repair, the following precautions should be observed to ensure that the 
 armature is not damaged:
Steps should be taken at all times to protect the commutator and 
• 
shaft-bearing surfaces.
Armature should not be rolled about the fl oor since injury to the 
• 
coils or banding may result.
Armature should be supported or lifted only by its shaft if possible. 
• 
Otherwise, a lifting belt should be used under the core.
Weight of the armature should never be allowed to rest on the 
• 
 commutator or coil heads.
Periodic inspection, varnish treatment, and curing will prolong the life of 
the winding. Loose slot wedges and banding should be replaced before 
 varnish treatment and curing. Cleaning, varnish treatment, and curing 
should include the operations listed under Section 10.9.6. Treatment of this 
type is defi nitely recommended for equipment that is subjected to excessive 
temperatures or contaminants and is desirable even though the equipment is 
not subject to adverse conditions. Windings dry out and loosen in operation, 
and loose windings fail rapidly when subjected to centrifugal stresses and 
vibrations. Varnish treatments fi ll the pores and crevices. They help to 
 preserve fl exibility in the insulation and hold the coils solidly in the slots, 
thereby keeping failures to a minimum.

582 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
If the armature is to be rebanded with steel wire, it is necessary to  duplicate 
very closely the banding originally furnished by the manufacturer with 
respect to material, diameter of the banding wire, width, and position of 
each band. Any change in banding width, position, or material could cause 
heavy current in the bands suffi cient to overheat and melt the solder.
Recent developments and tests of the use of resin-fi lled glass for the  banding 
of armatures have eliminated many of the risks inherent in the use of the metal 
bands. When correctly applied, the strength factor of resin-fi lled glass is equal 
to that of steel bands; therefore, replacement of the original banding by resin-
fi lled glass bands can be accomplished in the space  provided for steel bands if 
the magnetic fi eld is not disturbed. Since resin-fi lled glass is a good insulator, 
additional heavy insulation under the band is not required and eddy currents 
are nonexistent. It is imperative that resin-fi lled glass banding be applied under 
tension by an expert utilizing the correct  equipment as the forces the banding 
must withstand under full-speed and full-load conditions are signifi cant.
Commutation
Commutation is the process of collecting current from a commutator, which, 
at the same time, short-circuits those coils in which the current is reversed 
(Figure 10.9). Since there is voltage (even though small) generated in each of 
these short-circuited coils, a circulating current is present in the face of the 
carbon brush in addition to the load current. The voltage causing this circulat-
ing current is proportional to the load current and the speed, and, as the speeds 
and ratings of modern machines are increased this becomes a more serious 
factor. Since this voltage, under some conditions, becomes so high as to cause 
excessive sparking, it is the designer’s problem to control this reactive voltage 
by designing the machine to minimize the effect of the fl ux generated in the

armature circuit and by the judicious use of commutating poles, sometimes 
called interpoles. Successful commutation also requires a good continuous 
contact between the brush and the commutator surface.
It is obvious that successful commutation is not a function of the brush 
alone or of the commutator or electrical circuit alone but results from 
 optimum electrical and mechanical brush-to-commutator conditions, and 
the correct electromechanical position of the brush rigging.
Commutation is such a complex problem that it is necessary to keep the 
many adverse variables at a minimum. Commutation may be adversely 
affected by dust, dirt, gases, oil vapor, and the like, and varying atmospheric 
conditions such as high temperature or low humidity. Where a commutation 
problem exists owing to one or more of these ambient conditions, it is 
 sometimes possible to arrive at a solution by altering the unit to offset the 
condition. If the commutation of a unit is not satisfactory and a change in 
brush grade is indicated, the manufacturer should be consulted. However, 
in general, this is not a true solution.
The mechanical condition of the unit can also greatly affect commutation. 
Commutators should be periodically checked for high bars, which will cause 
fl ashing and generally poor commutation. Both commutators and slip rings 
should be smooth, round, and concentric with the axis of rotation. If there is 
any appreciable vibration, the cause should be determined and corrected.
Some of the most common service problems with commutator are shown 
in the commutator check chart (Figure 10.10). Frequent visual inspection of 
the commutator can indicate when any of the conditions shown in the Figure 
10.10 are developing so that corrective actions can be taken. The causes of 
poor commutator condition are shown in Table 10.6.
Frequent visual inspection of commutator surfaces can warn you when any 
of the above conditions are developing so that you can take early corrective 
action. Table 10.6 may indicate some possible causes of these conditions, sug-
gesting the correct maintenance. There are several causes of commutator prob-
lems. High commutator bars generally produce sparking, noisy operation, and 
chipped or broken brushes. The causes are usually a loose com mutator, incor-
rect undercutting, open or high resistance connections, or electrical shorts. 
Streaking or threading of the commutator surface causes rough surfaces with 
associated sparking. Primary faults can be
Low average current density in brushes due to light machine loading

Contaminated atmosphere
• 
Oil on commutator or oil mist in air
• 
Low humidity
• 
Lack of fi lm-forming properties in brush
• 
Brushes too abrasive
• 
Bar etching or burning produces a rough commutator with associated spark-
ing and eventual fl ashover. Such burning often results from

Dirty commutator

Machine operating overloaded or under rapid load change such as

Bar marking at pole pitch spacing produces a rough commutator with  associated 
sparking and eventual fl ashover. This burning is generally caused by electri-
cally shorted commutator bars or coils, open armature of fi eld circuits, severe 
load conditions, misalignment of the coupling, and vibration. The burning in 
the early stages is generally evident at one-half the number of poles.
Bar marking at slot spacing produces rough bars at regular intervals 
around a commutator. Since several coils are embedded in each armature 
slot, all the coils may not be equally compensated. The energy unbalance is

Satisfactory commutator surfaces
Light tan film over entire commutator
surface is one of many normal conditions
often seen on a well-functioning machine.
Molted surface with random film pattern 
is probably most frequently observe 
condition of commutators in industry.
Slot bar-marking, a slightly  darker film,

related to number of conductors per slot.
Heavy film can appear over entire
area of efficient and normal commutator

refl ected into the last coil in the slot to undergo commutation and will result 
in a spark at the brush. Such a spark will cause burned spots on the bars 
equally spaced according to the bars per slot ratio.
Selective commutation can occur on machines with more than one brush per 
brush stud if the resistance path of one brush is lower with respect to the other 
brushes on the same stud. Due to higher spring pressure, incorrect staggering of 
brushes, or a breakdown of the commutator fi lm in one path, the brush with the 
low contact drop will have a tendency to carry more than its share of the current.

Commutator check chart.
Watch for these danger signs 
(b)
Streaking on the commutator surface signals 
the begining of serious metal transfer to the 
carbon brush. Check the chart below for 
possible causes.
Grooving is a mechanical condition caused
by abrasive material in the brush or atmos
phere.It grooves form, start corrective action.
Threading of commutator with fine lines 
results when excessive metal transger 
occurs. It usually leads to resurfacing of 
commutator and rapid brush wear.
Copper drag, an abnormal build-up of 
commutator material, forms most often at 
trailing edge of bar. Condition is rare but can 
cause flashover if not checked.
Pitch bar-marking produces low or burned 
spots on the commutator surface. The 
number of these markings equals half or all 
the number of poles on the motor.
Heavy slot bar-marking can involve 
etching of trailing edge of commuta-
tor bar. Pattern is related to number of 
consuctors per slot.

The exposed portion of the front vee-ring insulation is normally the target 
for moisture, oil, and dirt, which may cause fl ashovers and breakdowns to 
ground. It is, therefore, essential that the exposed surface of the mica be kept 
clean and protected by means of other insulation. There are various ways to 
apply extra insulation at this point, depending upon the individual ideas of 
the machine designer. In general, however, this consists of a cord or tape of 
cotton or glass wound in tight layers over the surface of the exposed section 
of the mica cone or veering. The exposed surface is then treated with several 
coats of varnish suitable for the operating temperature of the machine. 
These multiple coats of varnish are applied to obtain a smooth, easily clean-
able surface. The purpose is to obtain extra insulation that will protect 
the vee-ring insulation and, so far as possible, seal the joint between the 
commutator bars and the vee ring.
10.9.3.4 Field Windings
If the fi eld winding of any type of DC motor is open circuited, the motor will 
fail to start or it will operate at excessive speed at light loads and serious 
sparking will occur at the commutator. It should not be concluded that a fi eld 
is defective until rheostats, switches, and other devices in the motor circuit 
have been carefully inspected.
To check for grounded fi elds, a conventional high-potential transformer 
may be used. If the fi eld circuit is free of grounds and shorted shunt fi eld is 
suspected, comparative resistance measurements should be made of the 
individual coils and compared with the resistance of a similar coil that is 
known to be in good condition. Such a comparative check should preferably 
be made when the fi eld windings are hot or near their normal operating 
temperature. A shunt fi eld coil may show the correct resistance when it is 
cold but may show a lower value when it is hot or near its normal operating 
temperature. This is due to defective insulation between turns of adjacent 
conductors, and short circuits may not occur until expansion has taken place 
because of the increased temperature. If the correct resistance value of good 
coils is not known, comparative checks made with either a Wheatstone bridge 
or by the voltmeter method will usually provide a reliable indication of shunt 
fi eld resistance. If neither a bridge nor an ammeter is available, a check as to 
the condition of the coils may be obtained by connecting all shunt coils in 
series to a source of constant potential and measuring the voltage drop across 
individual coils. For short circuits in series and commutating fi eld coils, 
where the resistance is necessarily low, the use of more sensitive instruments 
may be necessary to detect defects.
A common cause of fi eld coil failure is overheating, which may result from 
the following:
Operation of the machine at low speed, preventing correct ventilation
• 
Full fi eld current left on the machine continuously while it is shutdown
• 

588 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Excitation voltage too high
• 
Overloading machine
• 
High ambient temperature
• 
Faulty performance, indicated by poor commutation, incorrect speed, and 
overheating, is frequently traceable to defective fi eld coils or to incorrectly 
connected fi eld windings.
In removing a shunt or series fi eld coil, the coil should be disconnected 
from the adjacent coils, and the bolts that secure the pole pieces to the frame 
should be removed. This will make it possible to remove the pole piece and 
coil, after which the pole piece, with a new or reinsulated coil, can 
be installed. Particular care should be taken in replacing the pole with its coil 
to be sure that the same steel or nonmagnetic shims between the frame and 
the back of the pole are in the same position to ensure the same air gap that 
was present in the machine when it was new.
When reconnecting the coil, the correct polarity must be maintained. 
A simple means of testing the polarity is by the use of a compass, a magne-
tized needle, or a piece of magnetized steel wire suspended from the middle 
by a string. The polarity should be alternatively north and south around 
the frame. When the compass needle is brought within the magnetic fi eld of 
any pole, one end of the needle will point toward this pole and this end 
should be repelled by the next pole, and so on around the frame. If this rever-
sal of the needle does not occur, there is a faulty connection of one or more of 
the fi eld coils.
Since there is a possibility of reversing the poles of a compass with a strong 
fi eld, similar results can be obtained by putting the compass on a work 
bench, placing a steel scale against the pole of the machine, and then setting 
the scale against the compass. The readings will, of course, be reversed as 
compared to the direct reading with a compass.
10.9.4 Induction Motor
There are two types of AC induction motor construction: squirrel cage and 
wound rotor. Stator design is the same for both; they differ mainly in rotor 
design. There are no external rotating or secondary connections on a squir-
rel-cage motor; most wound rotors have three-phase winding connected 
through collector rings to an adjustable secondary resistance.
Today’s induction motor, especially the squirrel-cage type, is a highly 
effi cient machine whose periods of trouble-free service can be considerably 
prolonged by systematic care. Correct application and installation will mini-
mize maintenance requirements.
Essentially, maintenance of squirrel-cage induction motors centers on the 
stator windings and bearings. Rotors require little or no special care in 
normal service, except to make certain that bolts or other fasteners remain 
tightly secured. For wound-rotor types, rotor construction with the associated 
brush rigging requires additional maintenance.

Motors and Generators 
589
Stator windings differ in induction motors, depending on the size of the 
stator frame. Smaller motors, generally, are known as mush wound and are 
sometimes called random or wire wound. Mush-wound coils are made by 
looping wire in an elliptical form without exact dimensions. Coils are 
inserted, a few wires at a time, in semiclosed stator slots.
Larger motors utilize form-wound coils, constructed by winding magnet 
wire in a loop, which is then formed to an exact shape to meet specifi c  dimensions 
of width, height, and pitch. Coils are fi tted in open slots in the stator iron.
Since the life of a motor is limited largely by that of its insulation, proper 
care can greatly extend its service reliability. Maintenance of winding insu-
lation is mostly a matter of keeping the machine clean and dry, providing it 
with an adequate supply of cool, dry, ventilating air, and operating the 
machine within its rating.
10.9.4.1 Stator Windings
A regular schedule of inspection can prevent costly shutdowns and repairs 
by revealing small defects, which can be corrected before they develop into 
serious faults. The operating temperature of the machine should be checked 
a regular intervals. Open-type machines must be inspected more frequently 
than closed types, with the machines shutdown if possible.
The interior of larger machines is often inaccessible because of the end 
covers, air baffl es, and fans. These obstructions should be removed at regu-
lar intervals to permit a closer inspection.
The best way to evaluate the condition of insulation is to measure  the insu-
lation resistance at regular intervals when the machine is hot. A sudden 
decrease in the insulation resistance may indicate an approaching break 
down, which may be avoided if the cause is located and corrected in time.
10.9.4.2 Air Gap
A small air gap is characteristic of induction motors and has an important 
bearing on the machine’s PF. Anything that may affect the air gap, such as 
grinding the rotor laminations or fi ling the stator teeth, may result in 
increased magnetizing current and lower PF.
The air gap should be periodically checked with a feeler gauge to ensure 
against a worn bearing that might permit the rotor to rub against the stator 
core. Even slight rubbing of the rotor against the stator will generate enough 
heat to destroy the coil insulation.
Measurements should be made on the drive end of the motor. Openings 
are provided in the end shields and inner air baffl es of some machines for 
the insertion of feeler gauges for this purpose. This check is needed par-
ticularly for sleeve-bearing motors. A change in air gap seldom occurs in 
antifriction-bearing motors unless the bearing fails. For small sleeve-bearing 
motors without feeler gauge openings, a check of bearing wear using a dial 
indicator on the shaft extension should be considered.

590 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
A record of air gap checks should be kept, especially on larger machines. 
Four measurements should be taken approximately 90° apart. One point of 
the measurements should be made in the direction of load. A comparison of 
periodic measurements will permit early detection of bearing wear.
10.9.4.3 Wound-Rotor Windings
Rotor windings of wound-rotor motors have many features in common with 
stator windings, and the same comments apply to their care and mainte-
nance. However, the rotor requires additional consideration because it is a 
rotating element.
Most wound rotors have a three-phase winding and are susceptible to 
trouble from single-phase operation and open circuits. The fi rst symptoms of 
these faults are lack of torque, slowing down in speed, growling noise, or 
perhaps failure to start the load.
The fi rst place to look for an open secondary circuit is in the resistance or 
the control circuit external to the rotor. Short-circuiting the rotor circuit at 
the slip rings and then operating the motor will usually determine that the 
trouble is in the control circuit or in the rotor itself.
Some rotors are wave wound, with windings made up of copper strap coils 
with clips connecting the top and bottom halves of the coil. These end con-
nections should be inspected for possible signs of heating, which could be an 
indication of a partial open circuit. Faulty end connections are a common 
source of open circuits in rotor windings. The open circuit may be at one of 
the stud connections to the collector rings.
A ground in a rotor circuit will not affect motor performance except that in 
combination with another ground, it might cause the equivalent of a short 
circuit. This would have the effect of unbalancing the rotor electrically. 
Reduced torque is a symptom; others might be excessive vibration of the 
motor, sparking, or uneven wear of the collector rings. A test for this condi-
tion can be made with a megohmmeter.
Another fairly successful method of checking for short circuits in the 
rotor windings is to raise the brushes off the collector rings and energize 
the stator. A rotor winding that is free from short circuits should have little 
or no tendency to rotate, even when disconnected from the load. If there is 
evidence of considerable torque or a tendency to come up to speed, the rotor 
should be removed and the winding opened and examined for the fault. 
In making this test, it should be noted that some rotors having a wide tooth 
design may show a tendency to rotate even though the windings are in 
good condition.
With the rotor in place, the stator energized, and the brushes raised, the 
voltages across the collector rings should be check to see if they are balanced. 
These voltages bear no particular relation to the line voltage and may be con-
siderably higher. For example, they may be as high as 500 for a 200 V stator. 
To make sure that any inequality in voltage measurements is not due to the

relative positions of the rotor and stator phases, the rotor should be moved to 
several positions in taking these voltage measurements.
10.9.4.4 Brushes and Rings
Brushes and collector rings on wound rotors need special care. Although a 
certain amount of wear is inevitable, conditions that lead to grooving of rings 
(concentration of wear in narrow rings or ruts) should be prevented, and 
abrasive dust should be wiped off the rings at regular intervals.
Rough or uneven ring surfaces should be remedied as soon as possible, 
before sparing, pitting, and accelerated brush wear result. Allowing the rotor 
to oscillate axially will distribute wear more evenly. Unevenly worn brushes 
should be replaced to assure best operation.
10.9.4.5 Centrifugal Switches
Basically, all single-phase motors are designed with a special arrangement of 
winding for starting. To accomplish this, some method is used to automati-
cally change the electrical connections of a motor. This may be one of the 
following:
Starting and running windings, with centrifugally operated switches 
• 
to disconnect the starting winding.
Central switch to disconnect or change capacitor circuits.
• 
Potential relay (occasionally used instead of centrifugal switches).
• 
Repulsion-induction-type motor with wound rotor and commutator, 
• 
which utilizes a centrifugally operated switch to short-circuit the 
commutator at a predetermined speed.
Repulsion-inductor-type motor with wound rotor and commutator 
• 
and a squirrel-cage rotor winding that automatically come into use 
near full speed needs no transfer device.
It is usually more practical to replace defective centrifugal switches than to 
repair them.
10.9.4.6 Squirrel-Cage Rotors
Squirrel-cage rotors are more rugged and, in general, require less mainte-
nance than wound rotors. Open circuits or high-resistance joints between 
the end rings and the rotor bars may give trouble. The symptoms of such 
conditions are generally the same as with wound-rotor motors, that is, slow-
ing down under load and reduced starting torque. Look for evidence of heat-
ing at the end ring connections, particularly when shifting down after 
operating under load.

592 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Fractures in the rotor bars usually occur between the point of connection 
to the end and the point where the bar leaves the laminations. Discolored 
rotor bars are evidence of excessive heating.
Brazing or replacing broken bars requires considerable skill. Unless a capa-
ble serviceman is available, the manufacturer or an experienced service shop 
should be consulted before attempting such repairs at the plant.
10.9.5 Synchronous Motors and Generators
The stator of a synchronous machine requires approximately the same care 
as the stator of an induction motor. In large-sized synchronous machines, 
the windings are generally more accessible and this facilitates cleaning.
The rotor fi eld coils of a synchronous machine should be cleaned in the 
same manner as the fi eld coils on a DC machine. Slow-speed synchronous 
machines have rotor poles held by the spider with studs and nuts, while in 
high-speed synchronous machines a dovetail construction is utilized with 
tapered wedges securing the poles.
Some synchronous machines have the poles bolted to the shaft using bolts 
through the poles. Some 400-cycle synchronous generators utilize a lami-
nated fi eld structure with coils placed in slots, each tooth representing a pole. 
Following is a general maintenance guide for synchronous motors:
During any general overhaul, the nuts on the studs or the wedges for 
• 
the dovetail poles should be check for looseness. The amortisseur 
winding should be checked for loose or cracked connections.
In dusty installations where collector ring enclosures are not used, 
• 
the collector rings and brush holders should be blown off weekly 
with clean dry air. When oil deposits form on the collector ring or 
brush holder insulation, it should be cleaned by wiping with a suit-
able solvent and coated with a high-gloss insulating varnish. When 
cleaning the brush holders, the brushes should be removed to pre-
vent their absorbing the solvent.
Coat all insulated surfaces of the brush holders and slip rings with a 
• 
high-gloss insulating varnish. Caution should be exercised. Do not 
coat brush contact surfaces of the slip rings.
If the collector rings become eccentric, grooved, pitted, or deeply 
• 
scratched, this condition can best be corrected by grinding the rings 
with a rotating-type grinder, with the machine running at rated 
speed in its own bearing. Fine emery cloth or sandpaper should be 
used for light scratches on iron or steel rings but not on bronze 
rings.
Regardless of the method used, rings, should be polished to a high 
• 
gloss with crocus cloth and oil. After polishing, the rings should be 
thoroughly cleaned with a solvent to remove all abrasives and for-
eign materials.

Motors and Generators 
593
In as much as the wear due to electrochemical action is not the same 
• 
on both the positive and negative collector rings, it is suggested that 
the polarity be reversed about every 3 months of operation to com-
pensate for this condition.
Field current specifi ed on the nameplate should not be exceeded for 
• 
continuous operation.
10.9.6 Cleaning and Varnishing of Machine Windings
The life of a winding depends upon keeping it in its original condition as 
long as possible. In a new machine, the winding is snug in the slots, and the 
insulation is fresh and fl exible and has been treated to be resistant to the 
deteriorating effects of moisture and other foreign matter.
Moisture is one of the most subtle enemies of the machine insulation. 
Insulation should be kept clean and dry. Certain modern types of the insula-
tion are inherently moisture proof and require infrequent varnish treatment, 
but the great majority, if exposed to a damp atmospheric place, should be 
given special moisture-resisting treatment.
One condition that frequently hastens winding failure is movement of the 
coils caused by vibration during operation. After insulation dries out, it loses 
its fl exibility. Mechanical stresses caused by starting and plugging, as well as 
natural stresses in operation under load, sometimes precipitate short circuits 
in the coils and possibly failures from coil to ground, usually at the point 
where the coil leaves the slot.
Periodic varnish treatment and curing, correctly done so as to fi ll all spaces 
caused by drying and shrinkage of the insulation, will provide an effective 
seal against moisture and should be a matter of routine electrical mainte-
nance. Varnish treatment and curing of rotating electrical equipment follow 
a logical procedure.
10.9.6.1 Cleaning
Some machines are exposed to accumulations of materials, such as talc, lint, 
or cement dust, which although harmless by themselves may obstruct the 
ventilation. The machine will then operate at higher temperatures than 
normal, and the life of the insulation will be decreased. Such materials can 
sometimes be blown out with clean dry compressed air.
The most harmful types of foreign materials include carbon black, metallic 
dust and chips, and similar substances that not only impair the ventilation 
but also form a conductive fi lm over the insulation and increase the possibil-
ity of insulation failure. Metallic chips may also work themselves into the 
insulation because of the ventilation and magnetic fi elds. When windings 
are cleaned, inspection should be made for any signs of deterioration.
Epoxy-encapsulated windings, a construction fi nding increasing favor, 
are sealed against contaminants. They need little attention other than 

594 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
removing dirt accumulations. The common practice when such windings 
are damaged is replacement with a new winding.
It is extremely important that all wound stators and rotors be perfectly clean 
before varnish treatment and curing. Unless all conducting dirt and grease are 
removed, the varnish treatment will not be fully effective. Also, after varnish 
treatment, the leakage path caused by conducting materials will be diffi cult to 
uncover and remove. Correct cleaning involves the following steps:
Dirt should be removed from all coil surfaces and mechanical parts. 
• 
Air vent ducts should be clear. As an alternative, clean, dry air at a 
pressure of not more than 50 psi may be used. Higher air pressure 
may damage windings. Do not use air if dust from the machine can 
damage critical equipment nearby.
As much oil, grease, and dirt as possible should be removed by 
• 
wiping the windings with clean, dry cloths and then with clean 
cloths that have been moistened with a solvent recommended by the 
coil manufacturer. If the original varnish on the windings is cracked, 
a brush should be dipped in solvent and used to clean all conducting 
particles from the cracks.
For cleaning, armatures or wound rotors should be placed in a vertical 
• 
position with the commutator or collector ring end up, and a pressure 
spray gun with solvent should be used to clean under the collecting 
device and through vent holes. The same procedure should be repeated 
with the opposite end up, and then repeated again with the commuta-
tor or collector ring end up. Most large DC armatures are ventilated 
through open commutator risers at the front end. The solvent spray 
should be directed through these risers to reach the inner surface of 
the armature coils and inner commutator vee-ring extensions.
Silicone-insulated equipment can be cleaned by the same methods 
• 
used with other insulation systems. If a liquid cleaner is found to be 
necessary, the recommendations of the coil manufacturer should be 
followed.
For windings other than silicone, there are a number of good com-
• 
mercial cleaners on the market. The manufacturer can recommend 
the one most suitable for the conditions. Plant safety rules  concerning 
the use of fl ammable and toxic solvent should be observed and 
followed.
Caution should be exercised to remove all liquid cleaners.
• 
10.9.6.2 Drying
The wound apparatus should be dried in an oven held at a temperature of 
115°C–125°C (239°F–257°F) for 6–12 h or until the insulation resistance 
becomes practically constant. If a vacuum is used, the drying time may be 
reduced.

Motors and Generators 
595
The apparatus should be brought up to temperature slowly because 
excessive moisture may be present in the windings. If heated rapidly, this 
moisture may vaporize quickly enough to rupture the insulation.
Before treatment, the apparatus should be cooled to within 10°C (50°F) 
above room temperature, but never to a temperature lower than 25°C (77°F). 
If the apparatus is cooled to room temperature and allowed to stand, it will 
take up moisture quickly. If placed in the varnish at a temperature higher 
than that specifi ed, the varnish will tend to harden.
10.9.6.3 Varnish
The selection of varnish is dependent upon the operating conditions to which 
the motor is subjected; also, the type of environmental conditions (i.e., mois-
ture, corrosion, chemical, abrasion) should be taken into consideration.
Varnish must be compatible with the insulation system with which it is to 
be used. If it is incompatible, it may not adhere and may not give the desired 
protection. For most applications, the selection of a general-purpose high 
bonding, yet resilient, synthetic resin varnish is recommended. The varnish 
can be either class A, B, or F, depending upon the insulation system rating. 
On large AC stators using class A insulation, the use of a fl exible asphalt or 
oleoresinous varnish is suggested; then, if it becomes necessary to lift a coil, 
the coil will not be destroyed.
Many types of varnishes are available, and when applying the insulating 
varnish, the recommendation of the manufacturer should be followed with 
respect to specifi c gravity, viscosity, and curing cycle for the particular var-
nish in question. After the varnish has been adjusted to give the desired fi lm 
build and drainage characteristics, the specifi c gravity and viscosity read-
ings should be recorded; then at periodic intervals the varnish should be 
examined for either specifi c gravity or viscosity, or both, and adjustments 
should be made to bring it within the original limits.
The units should be cured in a correctly ventilated forced-air circulating 
oven to remove the solvent vapors. The oven can be either gas fi red or electri-
cally heated. Infrared heat can be used if desired.
For the most part, the time and temperature of the cure should follow the 
varnish manufacturer’s recommendations. The time of cure will vary from 
short bakes of several hours up through 16–24 h, based on the physical 
dimensions and makeup of the units, and taking into consideration the 
particular characteristics of the type of varnish that has been applied to 
the equipment.
Curing temperatures will vary from 75°C to 125°C (167°F to 257°F) for 
oleoresinous-type varnishes to 135°C to 155°C (275°F to 311°F) for classes 
B and F varnishes. Silicone varnishes usually require a cure temperature 
range of 185°C–200°C (365°F–392°F) or higher.
Complete rewinding jobs should receive at least two coats of varnish. 
Baking time can usually be reduced on the fi rst or impregnated coat, with 
an extended period of time used on the fi nal coat. The use of additional 

596 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
coats is based on what is expected of the unit after it is in operation. If severe 
conditions are to be encountered, multiple-coat systems are recommended. 
Also, apparatus such as high-speed armatures should receive multiple coats 
for the maximum bonding of the conductors. One coat is all that is neces-
sary on older units that have been cleaned up on which no rewind work has 
been done.
In the case of large stators or rotors where the size is such that dipping is 
not possible, the varnish must be sprayed on the windings. Old winding 
surfaces must be completely coated.
For most applications, conventional dip methods are recommended. Other 
accepted methods are brushing and fl ooding. However, if the length or depth 
of the slots is great and the windings tightly packed, it may be necessary to 
use a vacuum impregnation system.
10.9.7 Lubrication, Bearings, and Oil Seals
10.9.7.1 Lubrication
Of all the important items of maintenance, lubrication ranks as one of the 
highest. Incorrect oiling or greasing will produce as disastrous results as any 
other type of motor mistreatment.
Excess oil may get into the windings where it will collect dust and other 
foreign matter. Too much grease in antifriction bearings causes heat and 
sometimes failure of bearings and may also coat the windings. Most manu-
facturers furnish data on correct oiling and greasing, and numerous articles 
have been written on the subject. The important point is to set up a defi nite 
lubrication schedule and follow it. Years of experience have demonstrated 
that it is as bad to use too much as too little oil and grease.
Of equal importance is the type of oil or grease used. In general, the rec-
ommendations of the manufacturer or experienced oil companies should be 
followed. In some cases, for design reasons, manufacturers insist on the use 
of particular lubricants that have been adopted after exhaustive test by the 
manufacturer. It will pay to follow these recommendations.
10.9.7.2 Sleeve Bearings
Some oil-lubricated machines are shipped without oil and, in the case of 
large machines, the journals are often packed and treated for protection 
during shipment. The rotating elements may also be blocked to prevent 
damage to the bearings and journals during shipment. Where lubrication is 
required, the bearing must be opened, the packing removed, and the journal 
cleaned and fl ushed before fi lling the housing with oil. All motor and gen-
erator bearings should be checked for oil before starting up.
The bearings of all electrical equipment should be carefully inspected at 
scheduled periodic intervals in order to obtain maximum life. The frequency 
of inspection, including the addition of oil, changing the oil, and checking 

Motors and Generators 
597
the bearing wear, is best determined by a study of the particular operating 
conditions. If makeup oil is required in excessive amounts, an investigation 
for oil leaks should be started immediately.
The more modern types of sleeve-bearing housings are relatively dust and 
oil tight and require very little attention, since the oil does not become con-
taminated and oil leakage is negligible. Maintenance of the correct oil level 
is frequently the only upkeep required for years of service with this type of 
bearing.
Older types of sleeve bearings require more frequent inspection and check-
ing for wear, and oil changes should be made more often. Never add oil to 
bearings when the machine is running.
In most cases, the safe temperature rise for a bearing is considered to be 
within 40°C above the room ambient.
Small sleeve-bearing motors use either wool packing or fl uid wick for 
transferring the lubricant to sleeve bearings instead of oil-ring lubrication. 
Some of these small motors have provision for relubrication.
When electrical equipment must operate under extreme differences in air 
temperatures, the use of a lighter oil may be found desirable during cold 
weather.
Care should always be exercised in the use of reclaimed lubricating oils. 
The fi ltering operation should be positive and should remove all foreign and 
injurious matter.
A hot bearing is usually due to one of the following causes:
No oil.
• 
Poor grade of oil or dirty oil.
• 
Failure of the oil rings to revolve with the shaft.
• 
Excessive belt tension.
• 
Rough bearing surface.
• 
Incorrect fi tting of the bearing.
• 
Bent shaft.
• 
Misalignment of shaft and bearing.
• 
Loose bolts in the bearing cap.
• 
Excessive end thrust due to incorrect leveling. A bearing may become 
• 
warm because of excessive pressure exerted by the shroud of the 
shaft against the end of the bearing.
Excessive end thrust due to magnetic pull, with the rotating part being 
• 
sucked into the stator or fi eld because it extends farther beyond the 
magnetic structure or fi eld poles at one end than at the other end.
Excessive side pull because the rotating part is out of balance.
• 
If bearing becomes hot, the load should be reduced if possible and lubricants 
fed freely, loosening the nuts on the bearing cap. If the machine is belt 

598 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
 connected, the belt should be slackened. In case relief is not afforded, the 
load should be removed and the machine kept running slowly, where pos-
sible, until the shaft is cool in order that the bearing will not freeze. The oil 
supply should be renewed before starting the machine again.
A new machine should always be run unloaded or at slow speed for an 
hour or so to make sure that it operates correctly. The bearings should be 
carefully watched to observe that the oil rings revolve and carry a plentiful 
supply of oil to the shaft.
10.9.7.3 Antifriction Bearings
Ball or roller bearings carry the load by direct contact, as opposed to sleeve 
bearings, which carry the load on lubricating fi lm. Lubrication is necessary 
to minimize the friction and generation of heat caused by the balls rubbing 
on the outer race as they roll over the top or on the retainer of the cage.
Antifriction bearings require considerable care to prevent loss of end 
clearance, distortion of balls, and marking of races. If too much force is 
used in pressing the bearing on the shaft, the clearance may be destroyed. 
It is recommended that antifriction bearings be heated in a hot bath of clean 
oil rather than by the use of dry heat. When the bearing is pulled off, with 
all the stress on the outer race, both races may be damaged, with resultant 
failure when put back in service. The bearing manufacturer’s recommen-
dations should be followed when removing and reapplying this type of 
bearing.
Bearing manufacturers produce a bearing known as the prelubricated 
shielded bearing. Several years use of this bearing has demonstrated that, for 
many applications, no further lubrication is needed. Such bearing construc-
tion is usually indicated on the nameplate.
In general, to obtain maximum service, ball-bearing motors should be 
relubricated at intervals determined by the type, size, and service of the 
bearing. Many motor manufacturers offer as a guide a table suggesting 
the intervals between lubrication. These tables show time intervals between 
greasing that range from 3 months or so for motors operating in very severe 
service, as in conditions involving dirt or vibrating applications, those where 
the end of the shaft is hot, or subject to high ambient temperatures, to inter-
vals of up to 3 years for easy service, where motors operate for short periods 
or infrequently.
The bearing housing is usually arranged to introduce new grease and 
purge the bearing of old grease, allowing it to discharge through a partially 
restricted escape port or relief hole. This will, in general, allow fi lling to the 
desired degree, which is one-third to one-half full, leaving some space in the 
housing to allow for expansion of the grease.
It is again stressed that overgreasing can be just as harmful as undergreas-
ing. Overgreasing causes churning and internal friction that can result in 
heating, separation of the oil and soap, oxidation of the grease, and possible 
leakage through the retaining seals.

10.9.7.4 Installation of Oil Seals
The importance of correctly installing an oil seal cannot be overemphasized. 
Failure to observe correct installation procedures probably accounts for more 
cases of the incorrect functioning of oil seals than any other single cause. 
To secure the ultimate in satisfactory service, it is recommended that the 
following precautions be observed.
Correct seal
It is essential that the seal be the correct size for the installation. Oil seals are 
made for a specifi ed shaft size. When they are installed on a shaft of a larger 
diameter, there will be drag, frictional heat, and excessive wear on the seal-
ing element and shaft. When installed on a shaft having a smaller diameter, 
immediate leakage can occur.
Fluid contact
The seal should be assembled with the toe or wiping edge of the sealing ele-
ment pointing toward the fl uid to be retained. Exceptions for unusual appli-
cations must be by specifi cation in manuals or instructions furnished with 
the assembly.
Bore
The bore should be checked for adequate chamfer (30° angle to a minimum 
depth of 1/16 in.). The bore should be inspected for scratches and all sharp 
edges removed. The seal outside diameter should be correct for the bore in 
the assembly. When a leak at the outer edge of either metal or rubber-covered 
seals is caused by abrasion of the oil seal, it may be directly related to incor-
rect chamfer on the bore of the use of incorrect installation tools.
Shaft
The surface of the shaft should be uniform and free from burrs, nicks, 
scratches, and grooves. The surface fi nish should be between 10 and 20 μin. 
and, on a repair job, should be buffed to this thickness with crocus cloth.
Lubrication
In all cases, a lubricant should be applied to the shaft or to the sealing element of 
the oil seal. This aids installation and reduces heat buildup during the fi rst few 
minutes of run. The application of a lubricant to the outer periphery of a syn-
thetic rubber-covered seal will reduce the possibility of shearing or bruising.
Pressing tools
In pressing the seal into the bore, it is imperative that the correct-sized press-
ing tool be used to localize the pressure on the face of the seal and in direct 
line with the side walls of the seal case to prevent damage and distortion to 
the seal cases during the installation. When a seal must penetrate the bore 
below the surface, the correct pressing tool should be 1/32 in. smaller than 
the bore diameter. On installations where the seal is fl ush with the housing, 
the correct pressing tool should be at least 1/8 in. larger in diameter, and 
more if room permits. Care should be taken to avoid hammer blows, uneven 
pressure on seal surfaces, and cocking of the seal during this operation.

600 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
When an oil seal of open channel construction is pressed-fi t heel fi rst into 
the bore, an installation tool will be helpful. The tool is designed to have 
contact with the inside diameter of the seal case.
Shaft end
If the seal is to be installed toe fi rst, the end of the shaft should have a 30° by 
3/16 in. taper, or an installation tool must be used. If the seal is to be installed 
heel fi rst, no special precautions are necessary other than to remove burrs or 
sharp edges from the end of the shaft.
Shaft with keyways and the like
When an oil seal is installed over the keyway, splines, and the like, an instal-
lation thimble should be used with the outside diameter not more than 
1/32 in. over the shaft.
Pressure-lubricated bearings
Because of speed and bearing loading, it is necessary to pressure lubricate 
the bearings on some larger motors and generators. Pressure gauge readings 
may not show the amount of oil fl owing, but machines have a sight oil-fl ow 
detector where oil fl ow may be checked. Orifi ces in the feed lines may clog, 
and oil-fl ow detection devices will protect the bearings.
Bearing insulation
If the bearing is insulated, care must be taken so that the insulated bearing 
is not grounded by bearing temperature detectors or relays.
10.9.8 Brushes
Correct care of brushes, brush rigging, and current-collecting parts is a fun-
damental necessity if satisfactory performance is to be obtained. Adequate 
inspection is essential to the maintenance of this equipment and the follow-
ing points should be observed:
Brush holder box should be adjusted between 1/16 and 1/8 in. from 
• 
the surface of the commutator.
Care should be taken to see that dirt and particles broken from the 
• 
edges of brushes or the commutator have not lodged in the face of 
the brush.
Brushes must be correctly aligned, and the commutator brushes 
• 
must be correctly staggered, pairs of arms (+ or −) being set 
alternately.
Brush is affected by such adverse conditions as sparking, glowing, 
• 
rough commutator, severe chattering, no-load running, overload 
running, incorrect spring pressure, and selective action.
Brush on a machine that sparks or glows owing to load conditions, 
• 
off-neutral operation, or an electrical fault in the machine will be 
burned and pitted near the sparking edge.

Motors and Generators 
601
Severe chattering of the brush is caused by a high-friction fi lm on 
• 
the surface of the commutator or by incorrect spring pressure.
Brush chattering due to a high-friction fi lm occurs on machines 
• 
where there is considerable no-load or light-load running. The char-
acteristic curve of friction versus load current is of such a shape that 
minimum friction can be obtained at approximately 55 A/in.2 and as 
load current is either reduced or increased, the brush friction is 
increased. Accordingly, it is sometimes good practice, when a machine 
is running at very light loads for a considerable period of time, to lift 
one or more brushes per arm to bring the brush friction into the desir-
able range. Cases where the load current is above the normal values 
are more serious, because the higher currents produce sparking, 
overheating of the machine and brush chatter simultaneously.
Spring pressure has a direct effect on the riding characteristics of a 
• 
brush. A common error is to reduce spring pressure for cases where 
brush wear or marking of the commutator has been observed. This 
permits the brush to bounce on the commutator, which, in turn, 
causes sparking and selective action and produces a rough commu-
tator. On the other hand, excessive spring pressure causes brush 
wear and commutator wear, and usually lowers the electrical contact 
voltage drop to the point where satisfactory commutation is not 
obtained. Correct spring pressure should be 2½–5½ lb/in.2 for indus-
trial service and 5–10 lb/in.2 for traction service. The lower range on 
traction work will be found where spring-supported motors are 
used; axle-hung motors use the higher range.
When checking spring pressure, the action of the brush in the box 
• 
should be free. Dirt or gummy oil on the brush or in the brush box 
sometimes causes the brush to stick and in some cases, to completely 
break the contact between the brush and the commutator.
Commutator wear in various forms is frequently attributed to a brush 
• 
that is too hard. Actually, the abrasiveness of a brush does not result 
from its hardness. Some of the most abrasive brushes are soft to the 
touch or low when measured for scleroscopic hardness. The property 
in a brush of fi ve grade that causes abrasiveness is controlled by the 
brush manufacturer, who should be consulted for information as to 
the relative cleaning properties of the various grades.
10.9.8.1 Brush Adjustment
The brushes of a new machine are generally adjusted at the factory to 
the electrically neutral position, and it should not be necessary to change 
the adjustment. An exception to this rule may occur on large machines 
where an off-neutral setting is sometimes used to improve commutation. In 
any case, the method for identifying the correct brush position is given in 
the manufacturer’s instruction book. Various methods may be used for 

602 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
determining the neutral position. The kick method is commonly used as is 
outlined here.
With all brushes raised from the commutator and the machine standing 
still, voltages will be induced in the armature by transformer action if the 
shunt fi eld is excited to about one-half of its normal strength and the fi eld 
current suddenly broken. It will be found that the induced voltages in con-
ductors located at equal distances to the right and left of the main pole cen-
ters will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Hence, if the terminals of a low-reading voltmeter (5 V) are connected to 
two commutator bars on the opposite side of a main pole and exactly halfway 
between the centerlines of two main poles, the voltmeter will show no defl ec-
tion when the fi eld current is broken. The spacing of these commutator bars 
is, therefore, the correct distance between brushes on adjacent brush arms.
The most practical method of making this check is to make two pilot 
brushes of wood or fi ber to fi t the regular brush holder, each brush carrying 
in its center a piece of copper fi tted for line contact with the commutator bar. 
With a lead for the connection of adjacent brush arms, the brush rigging may 
then be shifted slightly forward or backward, as necessary, until breaking 
the fi eld current produces no defl ection on the voltmeter. By noting the posi-
tion at which no defl ection is obtained for each pair of brush arms, the aver-
age of the positions of neutral thus obtained will give the correct running 
location for the brushes.
A quick and convenient method of locating the neutral position on a 
DC motor and shunt fi elds is to check the speed of the motor in either direction 
with the same impressed line voltage. The position of the brushes that pro-
duces the same speed in either direction under the same voltage conditions is 
the correct neutral position.
Another shortcut is to take a piece of lamp cord and bend it in the middle, 
bringing the two ends together. The insulation should be removed for 1/2 in. 
on each end and the bare wires twisted together, fanning out to form a brush. 
When this brush is held so that it spans two bars at the outer end of the com-
mutator and moved with and against the direction of rotation, the point of 
least sparking at the ends of the wires is the correct location for the centerline 
of the brushes.
10.9.9 Balancing
Electrical failures are often ascribed to deteriorated insulation, open circuit, 
short circuit, and so on, but in many cases, failure of insulation results from 
mechanical disturbances. Unusual noises in electrical apparatus may be 
the result of grounds, short-circuited coils, changes in voltage or frequency, 
rubbing or looseness of parts, vibration, defective bearings, and many 
other causes.
Any unusual amount of vibration or an increase in machine vibration 
should be investigated immediately. Common causes of undue vibration, 
other than imbalance, or bearing wear, dirt accumulation, misalignment, 

Motors and Generators 
603
an incorrect or a settled foundation, uneven air gap, parts rubbing the 
 rotating element, sprung shafting, a short-circuited fi eld coil, or imbalanced 
stator currents in the case of AC machines. These should be investigated before 
balance weights are added or shifted. If at any time it should be necessary to 
remove the balance weights, they should be replaced in the same position.
Before disassembling a pole on high-speed machines, the axial position of 
that pole should be accurately marked so that it can be replaced in the same 
position. Should it become necessary to replace a fi eld coil, or a complete 
pole, the balance must be checked.
10.9.9.1 Need for Balancing
Vibrations produced by unbalanced rotating parts may result in the 
following:
Excessive bearing wear
• 
Noisy operation of the equipment
• 
Failure of structural parts
• 
Reduced overall mechanical effi ciency
• 
Vibration of machine parts or the supporting structure
• 
10.9.9.2 Imbalance Measurement
Imbalance is generally measured in ounce-inches (oz-in.). An imbalance of 
1 oz-in. in a rotating body will produce a centrifugal force equivalent to that 
produced by 1 oz of weight 1 in. from the rotational axis. A rotor weighing 
62.5 lb (1000 oz) whose mass center is displaced 0.001 from the rotational axis 
is 1 oz-in. out of balance.
Only force imbalance is measured by static balancing, which is a single-
plane correction. The part being balanced is not rotated. Dynamic balancing 
of a part by rotation is required when there is appreciable axle length because, 
by this method, force imbalance, moment imbalance, or a combination of 
both may be measured. This is a two-plane correction.
The balancing process is not complete until corrections have been applied 
relative to the size and that the exact location indicated by the balancing 
machine. Corrections for balance may be made by the addition or removal 
of metal.
10.9.10 Belts, Gears, and Pinions
10.9.10.1 Belts
In most industrial organizations, installation, adjustment, inspection, and 
care of belts is the responsibility of a specially trained individual or group. 
The application of belts involves alignment and belt tension, which affect 
bearing operation. Maintenance personnel must report belt alignments 

604 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
that seem inaccurate, tensions that appear excessive, and splices that look 
 doubtful. Drives having upward belt tension may be questioned. Bearing 
loads on sleeve-bearing motors should not be against that portion of the 
bearing where the oil is fed into the bearing. Action should be taken to pro-
tect the electrical apparatus when there is evidence of belt-produced static.
10.9.10.2 Gears and Pinions
Gears and gear trains are among the principal sources of noise and vibra-
tion. In designing such mechanisms, the manufacturer strives for the best 
tooth term to give the least amount of whip and backlash, with the gear 
center so located that the teeth mesh at the correct pressure points.
It is essential, therefore, that the bearings be so maintained that these gear 
center distances do not change. Correct lubrication of gears is essential to 
keep down the wear of teeth. A gear with worn teeth, even though it appears 
to have considerable life left in it, should be replaced to keep vibration and 
noise to a minimum.
10.10  Predictive Maintenance Guide on Motors 
and Variable Frequency Drives
Electrical maintenance personnel have for years been limited to trouble-
shooting motors with no more than a multimeter and an insulation resis-
tance tester (megohmeter). The insulation resistance tester unfortunately 
does not provide enough information to allow most technicians to feel totally 
confi dent in determining whether or not an electrical problem exists or not. 
The troubleshooting of motors has become more diffi cult in recent years 
since many motors today are coupled to variable frequency drives (VFDs). 
The VFD itself in many cases can cause problems in the motor since it pro-
duces harmonics that pollute the power supply to the motor. At the end of 
this section, a discussion is offered on VFD and its interaction with the motor 
to help the reader understand its impact on a motor.
There has always been an on-going struggle to utilize technology to iden-
tify problems in motors. Recently technologies, such as vibration analysis 
has been developed to aid in the identifi cation of problems in motors. When 
vibration analysis shows a two times line frequency (2 FL) spike, it is assumed 
that it must mean an electrical problem. However, it must be kept in perspec-
tive that there are many other variables that may be responsible for produc-
ing a 2 FL spike; therefore, removing a motor from service for an electrical 
repair due only to a high 2 FL could be a mistake, possibly an expensive one.
Also, just measuring the insulation resistance of motor windings may not 
be enough to say that the motor is fi ne for continued service or it can be put 
back in service after it has tripped off-line. The fact is numerous reasons can 
exist which causes a motor to trip that will not be seen by an insulation test, 

Motors and Generators

such as a turn-to-turn short. Breakdown in the insulation between  individual 
turns of a winding can occur inside a stator slot or at the end turn and be 
completely isolated from ground. Phase-to-phase shorts can occur the same 
way. If these faults are left unattended, they can result in rapid deterioration 
of the winding, potentially ending in a complete motor replacement. 
Restarting of a motor that has tripped should be considered only after these 
faults have been ruled out. Troubleshooting an electric motor that is  suspected 
to have an electrical problem requires checking the insulation system as well 
other components in the motor. To confi dently assess the electrical condition 
of a motor and ensure that it will run reliably, there are six electrical areas in 
a motor analysis that must be looked at during the troubleshooting effort. 
Missing any of these areas could result in missing the problem and not having 
enough information to make a correct decision. The six areas are illustrated 
in the Figure 10.11.
Predictive technologies and tools are available today to troubleshoot and 
test these areas of interest. PdMA Corporation is just one of the several 
 entities that have developed technologies and tools for diagnosing motor 
 problems. PdMA offers two instruments that go beyond the conventional 
insulation resistance (megohmmeter) tester and multimeter for predictive 
maintenance and troubleshooting. These instruments are EMAX and MCE. 
How they can be used to help diagnose motor problems in the six electrical 
areas of a motor and how to evaluate these areas are discussed next.
10.10.1 Power Quality
Power quality has recently been thrust in the forefront due to the application 
of AC and DC drives, as well as other nonlinear loads. The variable frequency 
drives (VFDs) and other nonlinear loads can signifi cantly increase the  distortion 
levels of voltage and current. How can this distortion be minimized? What 
equipment is required, and is the concern purely fi nancial or is equipment at 
risk? Power quality problems as it pertains to motor health involve voltage 
and current harmonic distortion, voltage spikes, voltage unbalance or imbal-
ance and PF. The basic principle that ties them all together including thermal 
heating are discussed in this guide from the perspective of motor reliability 
and troubleshooting.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
By developing a methodical step-by-step process, power analysis (PA) 
tests using a power quality analyzer, such as PdMA’s EMAX shown in 
Figure 10.12, can be used to get information on quality of the power supply 
being delivered to the motor. These test results can quickly be used to assess 
three of the six areas listed above. These areas are derived from the most 
common electrically related motor failures in an industrial environment. 
This discussion focuses primarily on the quality of the power supply to the 
motor, followed by a recommended process on how to evaluate the data 
recorded during a PA capture.
The EMAX is a dynamic tester that collects data while the motor is operat-
ing. This information can be used to evaluate incoming power quality, motor 
effi ciency, rotor, stator, air gap, and power circuit conditions. It simultane-
ously collects all three phases of current and voltage to provide spectral and 
digital data in the areas of power, motor current, signature analysis, effi -
ciency, crest factor (CF), total harmonic distortion (THD), sequence data, PF, 
impedance, current, and voltage.
Power quality refers to the condition of the voltage and current signals. 
Single- and three-phase nonlinear loads, VFDs, switch-mode power supplies, 
starting and stopping of large inductive loads, voltage spikes, and the like 
that can cause poor power quality. These infl uences can cause excessive 
 harmonics on the electrical distribution system, which can result in overheat-
ing of the insulation system and other undesirable effects on the electrical 
distribution equipment. The term “power quality” is used for defi ning the 
quality of power supplied to the motor to do its job. But what is being  actually

evaluated is the quality of the voltage that is being  supplied to the motor 
circuit. The power supply system can only control the quality of the voltage; 
it has no control over the currents that a particular load might draw.
PA test allows a technician to take a power quality snapshot in order to 
see the condition of the voltage signal and evaluate the effect it will have on 
the motor. The actual sample time for the simultaneous measurement of 
the three voltage and current phases takes 0.17 s or less. From this snap-
shot, the technician focuses primarily on the three phase-to-phase voltages 
of the power delivered to the motor and determines what effect they are 
having on motor performance.
Data used to evaluate power quality is located in the phase-to-phase volt-
age section of the results page as is shown in Figure 10.13. In Figure 10.13, the 
result page shows among other data the input power to the motor, funda-
mental root mean square (rms), total rms, CF, and THD for each of the phase-
to-phase voltages. The average voltage and percent imbalance are also listed. 
Additionally, recommended NEMA derating factors are provided for both 
phase-to-phase voltage imbalance and harmonic voltage factor (HVF).
The motor, or for that matter any three-phase machine, is a symmetrical 
device and is designed to operate on three-phase balanced sinusoidal volt-
ages. When line voltages applied to a motor are not equal, negative sequence 
currents are introduced into the motor windings. The negative sequence cur-
rents fl ow in the windings of the motor in the opposite direction to the 
normal (positive sequence) currents. Therefore, these negative sequence 
currents produce an air gap fl ux that rotates in opposite direction to the rota-
tion of the motor. This reduces the net motor torque, affecting its operation 
and increasing the temperature rise of the motor.
NEMA standard MG1-2006 provides a recommended derating factor based 
on percent voltage imbalance (Figure 10.14). The usual recommendation is to 
FIGURE 10.13

608 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
not run a motor when the voltage imbalance is greater than 5% (per NEMA 
MG-1). For a given phase-to-phase voltage imbalance, rated horsepower of an 
induction motor should be multiplied by the derating factor in accordance 
with the NEMA MG1-2006 recommendation. If the load on the motor exceeds 
this derated value, take steps to correct the imbalance, or reduce the load on 
the motor. Running the motor with the imbalanced voltage will cause exces-
sive temperature rise in the windings and damage the insulation.
Terminal Voltage
Terminal voltage has a major effect on motor performance. The effect of low 
voltage on electric motors is well known and understood; however, the effect 
of high voltage on motors is often misunderstood. The effects of low and 
high terminal voltages are discussed next.
Effects of low voltage
When a motor is operated below nameplate rated voltage, some of the motor’s 
characteristics will change slightly and other characteristics more dramati-
cally. To drive a fi xed mechanical load, a motor must draw a fi xed amount of 
power from the circuit to produce the necessary torque to drive the load. The 
amount of power is roughly related to the voltage times current. So with a 
lower voltage, there will be a rise in current to maintain the required power. 
In terms of torque, the torque produce by the motor is proportional to the 
square of the voltage. For example, if the voltage to the motor is reduced by 
10%, the torque will be reduced by 19%. This in itself is not alarming, unless 
the torque delivered by the motor is less than the torque required by the 
fi xed load. In order to produce the necessary torque the motor will draw 
more current, therefore rise in current may exceed the nameplate current 
rating of the motor. When this happens the buildup of heat within the motor 
will damage the insulation system.
Aside from the possibility of overtemperature and shortened insulation 
life, other important effects on the motor’s performance need to be under-
stood. Starting, pull-up, and pull-out torque of induction motors all change 
based on the applied voltage squared. Thus, a 10% reduction from nameplate

voltage (100%–90%) would reduce the starting, pull-up, and pull-out torque 
to 81%. At 80% terminal voltage, the motor would produce 64% torque of the 
nameplate values. Clearly, it would be diffi cult to start those hard-to-start 
loads under such conditions. Similarly, the motor’s pull-out torque will be 
much lower than during normal voltage conditions.
Effects of high voltage
A common misconception is that high voltage tends to reduce current draw 
on a motor, since low voltage increases the current. This is not always the case. 
High voltage on a motor tends to push the magnetic portion of the motor into 
saturation. This causes the motor to draw excessive current in an effort to 
magnetize the iron beyond the point to which it can easily be magnetized. 
Generally, motors will tolerate a certain change above nameplate voltage; 
however, extremes above this value will cause the amperage to go up with a 
corresponding increase in heating and a shortening of motor life. For example, 
motors are generally designed to operate satisfactorily with a band of ±10% in 
accordance with NEMA standards. Even though this is the so-called tolerance 
band, the best performance would be at rated terminal voltage. Operation at 
the ends of this band would put unnecessary stress on the motor.
These tolerance bands are in existence not to set a standard that can be 
used all the time, but rather to set a range that can be used to accommodate 
the normal hour-to-hour swings in-plant voltage. Continuous operation at 
either the low or high end of the band will shorten the life of the motor.
The graph shown in Figure 10.15 is widely used to illustrate the general 
effects of high and low voltage on the performance of T-frame motors. It is 
acceptable to show general effects, but remember these effects will change 
slightly from one motor design to another. High voltages will always tend to

reduce PF and increase losses in the system, which results in higher operating 
cost for the equipment and the system. The following guidelines are pro-
vided for assistance in evaluating the voltage of a motor circuit:
Small motors tend to be more sensitive to overvoltage and saturation 
• 
than large motors
U-frame motors are less sensitive to overvoltage than T frames
• 
Premium/high effi ciency motors are less sensitive to overvoltage 
• 
than standard effi ciency motors
Overvoltage can drive up amperage and temperature even on lightly 
• 
loaded motors; thus, motor life can be shortened by high voltage
Full-load effi ciency drops with either high or low voltage
• 
PF improves with lower voltage and drops sharply with high voltage
• 
Inrush current goes up with higher voltage
• 
Simply put, the best life and effi cient operation of electric motors occurs 
when motors are operated at voltage as close to nameplate ratings as possible.
Harmonics
The presence of harmonic distortion in the applied voltage to a motor will 
both increase electrical losses and decrease effi ciency. These losses will 
increase motor temperature, resulting in even further losses. High harmon-
ics can result in a temperature rise in motor temperature. NEMA MG1-2006 
provides a chart for recommended harmonic derating factor known as HVF 
to aid in evaluating the harmonic voltage effects on the motor’s performance. 
Figure 10.16a shows sinusoidal current and voltage waveforms of a linear 
load such as a motor. Figure 10.16b shows the nonsinusodial current and 
voltage waveforms of nonlinear load, such as drawn by a VFD.
When performing PA testing of motor circuits, the power analyzer, such as 
EMAX, samples the applied voltage signal. It analyzes the voltage waveform, 
identifi es the fundamental frequency and all harmonics present and their 
percent of the waveform. With this information the HVF is calculated and, 
if required, recommended derating per NEMA guidelines is provided. The 
HVF derating curve is shown in Figure 10.17.
There is usually no need to derate motors if the voltage distortion remains 
within Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard 519-
1992 limits of 5% THD and 3% for any individual harmonic. Excessive heat-
ing problems begin when the voltage distortion reaches 8%–10% and higher. 
Such distortion should be corrected for long motor life.
The PA test, i.e., snap shot of power quality, provides a wealth of detailed 
information for identifying the power quality being delivered to the motor in 
a distribution system. In addition, this simple to perform test also provides 
the data required for detailed evaluation of motor circuits that utilize VFDs. 
Phase-to-phase voltage, harmonic distortion, bus voltage, and THD have an 
effect on the performance and condition of a motor.

voltage and current supplying a VFD. (Courtesy of PdMA Corporation, Tampa, FL.)
10.10.2 Power Circuit
The power circuit refers to all the conductors and connections that exist from 
the point at which the testing starts through to the connections at the motor. 
This can include circuit breakers, fuses, contactors, overloads, disconnects, 
and lug connections. A 1994 demonstration project on industrial power dis-
tribution systems found that connectors and conductors were the source of 
46% of the faults reducing motor effi ciency. When evaluating the condition of 
a motor, it is a good practice to use as many technologies as possible. The 
anomalies in a power circuit and how to identify them are discussed next.
Power circuit refers to all the conductors and connections that exist from 
the power supply bus to the connections at the motor. This can include cir-
cuit breakers, fuses, contactors, overloads, disconnects, and lug connections. 
Many times a motor, although initially in perfect health, is installed into a 
faulty power circuit. This causes problems like voltage imbalances, current 
imbalances, etc. As these problems become more severe, providing the 

612 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
same  horsepower output from the motor requires more current, causing 
 temperatures to increase and insulation damage to occur. The PA test as dis-
cussed under power quality is performed on energized AC induction, AC 
synchronous, AC wound-rotor motors, and motors being powered by VFDs. 
The PA test indicates anomalies in the power circuit, power quality, and the 
stator fault zones.
High resistance connections in the power circuit result in unbalanced termi-
nal voltages at the motor. The consequences of the unbalanced terminal voltage 
are overheating of the components adjacent to the high resistance connection, 
loss of torque, other phases drawing additional current to compensate, over-
heating of the insulation system, and a decrease in motor effi ciency. Voltage 
imbalances will cause the motor to draw more current in order to perform the 
required work. Therefore, this could lead to premature single-phasing or motor 
burn out resulting in shutdown of a process due to the failed motor.
The values from the PA test that are used to evaluate the health of the power 
circuit are: phase-to-phase voltage, phase-to-phase current, and their respective 
imbalances. These measured values are recorded and compared against indus-
try standards. An unbalanced power delivery not only causes a voltage imbal-
ance but also causes a much higher percent current imbalance. Some rules of 
thumb to apply when troubleshooting the power circuit are listed next.
A 1% voltage imbalance can result in a 6%–7% current imbalance, 
• 
according to the Electrical Apparatus Service Association.
A 3.5% voltage imbalance can raise winding temperatures by 25%, 
• 
according to the Electrical Power Research Institute.
A 10°C increase in winding temperature (above design) can result in 
• 
a 50% reduction of motor life.

Phase voltage unbalance causes three-phase motors to run at temperatures 
greater than their published ratings. This excessive heating is due mainly to 
negative sequence currents attempting to cause the motor to turn in a direc-
tion opposite to its normal rotation. These higher temperatures soon result in 
degradation of the motor insulation and shortened motor life. The percent 
increase in temperature of the highest current winding is approximately two 
times the square of the voltage unbalance. For example, a 3% voltage unbal-
ance will cause a temperature rise of about 18%. The greater the unbalance, 
the higher the motor winding temperature and the sooner the insulation will 
fail. NEMA standards recommend a maximum voltage unbalance of 1% 
without derating the motor. The motor can be derated down to 75% for a 
maximum of a 5% voltage unbalance. If the voltage unbalance exceeds 5%, 
it is recommended that the motor not be operated.
The easiest way to test a power circuit is using the PA test while the motor 
is under normal operating condition. A current imbalance is a possible indi-
cation of a high resistance connection. However, a voltage as well as a current 
imbalance is a better indicator. What determines whether both imbalances 
are present in the event of a high resistance connection is the test location.
Both voltage and current imbalances are not a requirement in the event of 
a fault in the power circuit. There can be many different reasons to look for a 
high resistance connection, a power circuit component failure, or an imbal-
ance that points to another fault zone. Trending power circuit anomalies is 
most effective at similar loads. Higher loads may result in the fault being 
more obvious due to the stresses being greater at higher loads. The easiest 
way to verify the current draw of a motor is by looking at the percent full-
load amperes (% FLA) in the current section on the results page of the power 
analyzer as shown in Figure 10.18.
As mentioned earlier, a current imbalance is a possible indicator of a power 
circuit anomaly. This is because the location of the anomaly in reference to 
FIGURE 10.18

Corporation, Tampa, FL.)

614 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
the voltage test leads will show different imbalances. However, measured 
current values are consistent regardless of test location. Figure 10.19 shows 
how voltage readings can change based on test location. If the test is being 
performed upstream of the anomaly, then there will only be a current imbal-
ance, and if the test is downstream, there will be both a current and voltage 
imbalance.
Loads using three-phase power sources are subject to loss of one of the 
three phases from the power distribution system. This condition is known as 
single-phasing of the primary power supply system. The loss of one phase, 
or leg, of a three-phase line causes voltages to become unbalanced on the 
secondary distribution power system, thereby causing serious problems for 
motors. The motor windings will overheat due primarily to the fl ow of nega-
tive sequence currents, a condition that exists anytime there is a phase volt-
age imbalance. The loss of a phase also inhibits the motor’s ability to operate 
at its rated horsepower.
In conclusion, a high resistance connection results in voltage and current 
imbalances, which reduces the horsepower rating signifi cantly. When a good 
motor is installed into a faulty power circuit, it causes problems with power 
imbalances, as well as, negative sequence currents. As the problems become 
more severe, the horsepower rating of the motor drops causing temperatures 
to increase resulting in overheating of adjacent components, damage to the 
rotor, stator, insulation, shortened motor life, reduced motor effi ciency, motor 
failure, or fi re. While damage to the rotor, stator, or insulation might be 
symptoms of a problem; the root cause still lies with the power circuit.

Replacing the motor without fi xing the high resistance connection causes the 
failure cycle to begin again.
10.10.3 Insulation Condition
This refers to the insulation between the windings and ground. High tem-
peratures, age, moisture, and dirt contamination all lead to shortened insula-
tion life. It has been said that if the industry would just use the space heaters 
available to keep the insulation dry, then doubling the life of our motors 
would not be out of the question.
The importance of having good electrical insulation systems is obvious. 
The designs and applications of electrical equipment are almost infi nite in 
their variety, but all units have one common characteristic. For electrical 
equipment to operate correctly, one of the most important characteristics is 
that the fl ow of electricity takes place along well-defi ned paths or circuits. 
These paths are normally limited to conductors, either internal or external to 
the electrical component. It is important that the fl ow of current be confi ned 
to defi ned conducting paths and not leak from one path to another through 
materials not intended to become conducting paths. Deterioration of insula-
tion systems can result in an unsafe situation for personnel exposed to the 
leakage current.
Despite great strides in electrical equipment design in recent years, the 
weak link in the chain is still the insulation system. When electrical equip-
ment fails, more often than not the fault can be traced to defective insulation. 
Even though an electric motor is correctly designed and tested prior to instal-
lation, there can be no guarantee that a fault in the insulation will not occur 
at some time in the future.
Many outside infl uences affect the life of electrical insulation systems. 
Outside infl uences include contamination of the insulation surfaces with 
chemicals from the surrounding atmosphere that attack and destroy the 
molecular structure, physical damage due to incorrect handling or acci-
dental shock, vibration, and excessive heat from nearby industrial pro-
cesses. Voltage transients in the conductors inside the insulation, such as 
surges or spikes caused by VFDs, can lower the dielectric strength to the 
point of failure. The deterioration occurs in many ways and in many places 
at the same time. For example, as chemicals and heat change the molecular 
structure of the insulating materials, they become semi-conductive, 
 allowing more current to be forced through them by voltage resulting in 
leakage current.
Correctly conducted insulation system testing, analysis of the data  collected, 
and followed by appropriate corrective actions can minimize the possibility 
of failures. Therefore, the signifi cance of understanding insulation system 
testing has never been more important. The reader should refer to Chapters 1 
and 2 for detail discussion of insulation (dielectric) theory and practice and 
conducting tests using DC voltage. A brief overview of the subject matter is 
offered here from the perspective of motor-winding insulation.

616 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Insulation resistance measurements
The insulation system of motor windings is often checked using DC voltage 
tests. One of the most common test conducted is to measure the insulation 
 resistance of the motor windings using an insulation resistance tester. When 
testing insulation with DC voltage, the total current drawn is the sum of four 
different currents: surface leakage, geometric capacitance, conductance, and 
absorption.
The surface leakage current is constant over time. Moisture or some other 
type of partially conductive contamination present in the machine causes a 
high surface leakage current, i.e., low insulation resistance.
The geometric capacitance current is a reversible component of the mea-
sured current on charge or discharge that is due to the geometric capaci-
tance. That is the capacitance as measured with AC of power or higher 
frequencies. With direct voltage, this current has a very short time constant 
and does not affect the usual measurement.
The conduction current in well-bonded polyester and epoxy-mica insula-
tion systems is essentially zero unless the insulation has become saturated 
with moisture. Older insulation systems, such as asphaltic-mica or shellac 
mica-folium may have a natural and higher conduction due to the conductiv-
ity of the adhesive tapes used as backing of the mica.
The absorption current is made of two components: the polarization of the 
insulation material and the gradual drift of electrons and ions through the 
insulating material. The polarization current is caused by the reorientation of 
the insulating material. This material, usually epoxy, polyester, or asphalt 
tends to change the orientation of their molecules when in the presence of a 
DC electric fi eld. It normally takes a few minutes of applied voltage for the 
molecules to be reoriented, and thus for the current-supplied polarizing energy 
to be reduced to almost zero. The absorption current, which is the second com-
ponent, is the gradual drift of electrons and ions through the insulating mate-
rial. These electrons and ions drift until they become trapped at the mica 
surfaces usually found in motor insulation systems. The positively and nega-
tively charged molecules of an insulation system are shown in Figure 10.19.
Figure 10.20a shows the random orientation of the insulation’s molecules. 
As DC voltage is applied to the insulation, the molecules start to polarize and 
align, as shown in Figure 10.20b. The energy required to align the molecules, 
and subsequently reduce the amount of escaping  molecules, is known as 
absorption current. Since absorption  current is a property of the insulation 
material and the winding temperature, a specifi c absorption  current is neither 
good nor bad. The absorption currents will vary from different insulating  material. 
Prior to 1970, older thermo plastic materials used for motor winding insulation 
were typically asphalt or shellac, which has a higher absorption current.
After 1970, the shift was made to thermosetting polyester or epoxy-bonded 
insulating material, which signifi cantly decreased the absorption current. 
Nonetheless, this does not mean that the more modern insulating materials 
are better because they have less absorption current. The amount of applied 
voltage must be appropriate to the nameplate voltage and the basic  insulation 
condition. This is particularly important in small, low-voltage machines 

Motors and Generators

where there is only a single layer of insulation. If test voltages are too high, 
the applied voltage may over stress the insulation. See Table 10.7 for recom-
mended voltage application.
Also, the capacitance value of insulation may be measured to refl ect on 
the cleanliness of the windings. A buildup of contamination on the surface 
of the windings results in higher capacitance readings. With a buildup of 
contamination on the insulation surface, dirty windings produce higher 
capacitance values than clean ones do. Over time, capacitance values 
steadily increased indicating an accumulation of dirt and that cleaning is 
necessary.

Effects of contamination
There are many factors that can affect insulation resistance. The surface leak-
age current is dependant upon foreign matters, such as oil and carbon dust on 
the winding surfaces outside the stator slot. The surface leakage current may 
be signifi cantly higher on large turbine generator rotors and DC machines, 
which have relatively large-exposed creepage surfaces. Dust and salts on insu-
lation surfaces, which are ordinarily nonconductive when dry, may become 
partially conductive when exposed to moisture or oil, and this will cause 
increased surface leakage current and lower insulation resistance. The reason 
a motor’s capacitance increases with contamination is because of how a capaci-
tor works. Any two conducting materials, called plates, separated from each 
other by a dielectric material, form a capacitor. A dielectric material is anything 
that is unable to conduct direct electric current. A cable or motor winding sur-
rounded by insulation provides one conductor and the dielectric material. The 
second plate is formed by the stator core and motor casing iron. It is this second 
plate that is increased in plate size as contamination builds up.
Effects of temperature
A higher temperature affects the resistance of both the insulation and conduc-
tor. There is a term called temperature coeffi cient (KT). A material has either a 
positive or negative KT. If the material has a positive KT, then with added heat 
the resistance readings will increase. Inversely, if a material has a negative KT, 
then the resistance readings will decrease with higher temperature. In metals, 
i.e., the magnetic wire of the stator, higher temperature introduces greater ther-
mal agitation and reduces the movements of free electrons. Because of this 
reduction in free movement, the resistance readings will increase with added 
heat and therefore the conductor has a positive KT. However, in insulation, the 
added heat supplies thermal energy, which frees additional charge carriers 
and reduces the resistance reading. Therefore, an increase in temperature on 
insulation reduces the resistance and it is said to have a negative KT. This higher 
temperature affects every current except the geometric capacitive current.
The recommended method of obtaining data for an insulation resistance 
versus winding temperature curve is by making measurements at several 
 winding temperatures, all above the dew point, and plotting the results on a 
semilogarithmic scale. Since this type of temperature coeffi cient plotting is usu-
ally not feasible, it is recommended to avoid the effects of temperature in trend 
analysis, subsequent tests should be conducted when the winding is near the 
same temperature as the previous tests. Otherwise the insulation test values 
should be corrected to a common base temperature of 40°C for trend analysis.
Therefore, resistance-to-ground readings must be temperature corrected for 
trending and comparison purposes. Temperature correction of the reading is 
required because the temperature of the insulation system under test may 
vary depending on operating conditions prior to testing, atmospheric condi-
tions, or ambient temperature. Insulation material has a negative temperature 
coeffi cient, which means that the resistance characteristics vary inversely with 
temperature. In the test setup screen of a standard test, the temperature of the 
windings will have an effect on the measurement. The measured megohm 
value is then adjusted to a  temperature correction to 40°C. The result is the 

Motors and Generators 
619
corrected megohm readings. To accurately trend resistance reading for a motor 
over time, keep the test voltage and duration of applied voltage constant.
The temperature-corrected megohm readings should be recorded and 
graphed for comparison over time. If a downward trend is observed, look for 
dirt or moisture. A single reading will not have much meaning in regards to the 
overall health of the insulation system; a reading as low as 5 MΩ may be accept-
able if related to a low-voltage application. See Table 10.8 for  recommended 
minimum insulation resistance. Also, refer to Section 2.10.1 in Chapter 2 for 
 additional discussion on recommended minimum insulation resistance values.
This is important because dirt and contamination reduce the motor’s abil-
ity to dissipate heat generated by its own operation, resulting in premature 
aging of the insulation system. A general rule of thumb is that a motor’s life 
decreases by 50% for every 10°C increase in operating temperature above the 
design temperature of the insulation system. Heat raises the resistance of 
conductor materials and reduces the insulation resistance of the winding 
insulation, and therefore breaks down the insulation. These factors accelerate 
the development of cracks in the insulation, providing paths for unwanted 
current to fl ow to ground. The effects from temperature to insulation resis-
tance are shown in Figure 10.21.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Polarization index and dielectric absorption
The polarization index (PI) and dielectric absorption (DA) tests are performed 
with a megohmmeter on a deenergized motor. It is not necessary to perform a 
DA test if a PI test is performed. Refer to Sections 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.1.3 for descrip-
tion of DA and PI tests. The purpose of the PI test is to determine whether or 
not a motor’s insulation system is suitable for continued service. The PI test is 
not limited to AC induction motors only. It also applies to wound-rotor motors, 
salient pole machines, and certain DC fi elds. The DC fi eld would have to have 
conductors that are fully encapsulated in insulation. Therefore, the PI test can 
be a worthwhile test for multiple type machines. When performing a PI test, 
it is not necessary to correct for temperature. Since the machine temperature 
does not change appreciably between the 1 min and the 10 min readings, the 
effect of temperature on the PI is usually small. However, if the motor recently 
shut down and a PI test is performed, the results may be a substantial increase 
in insulation resistance. This would result in an unusually high PI, at which 
point additional testing should be performed once the windings have cooled to 
40°C or lower. Refer to Table 2.14 in Chapter 2 for Interpretation of PI and DA 
data. Excellent results should indicate a PI ratio of 2–4, achieve higher than 
minimal insulation resistance values, and should be a nonsporadic rise in the 
megohm readings as shown in Figure 10.22.
Erratic insulation resistance values occurring at anytime during the test are 
indicative of short-term current transients. These may be due to contamina-
tion or moisture. It is important to know how low the insulation resistance 
values fall to in order to grade the insulation. For example, the IEEE standards 
FIGURE 10.22

PdMA MCE. (Courtesy of PdMA Corporation, Tampa, FL.)

Motors and Generators 
621
recommend minimum insulation resistance value of 100 MΩ for form-wound 
coils. Figure 10.23 shows insulation resistance values dipping below the sug-
gested minimum value of 100 MΩ for a form-wound coil. The PI and DA tests 
can be both used as go–no-go, based on the minimum insulation resistance 
readings.
The PI value of greater than 4 does not necessarily mean that the health of 
the insulation system is good. The higher PI value may indicate other prob-
lems with the insulation system, such as being too dry and brittle indicating 
that it has lost some or all of its mechanical properties. According to the 
EASA’s principles of large AC motors, it states that PI ratios of greater than 5 
should be considered the result of dry or brittle insulation. This may be 
because of age of the insulation or operating the motor at higher than designed 
temperatures as shown in Figure 10.24. A very dry or brittle insulation may 
indicate good insulation resistance but it may not have the necessary  dielectric 
strength and mechanical pliability.
10.10.4 Stator Condition
When discussing the stator, we are referencing the DC or three-phase AC 
windings, insulation between the turns of the winding, solder joints 
between the coils, and the stator core or laminations. This fault zone creates 
a lot of debate as to the cause and rate of failure. The stator fault zone is 
FIGURE 10.23
Graph showing megohm values falling below the minimum value. Sample result page from 
PdMA MCE. (Courtesy of PdMA Corporation, Tampa, FL.)

622 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
often  considered one of the most controversial areas due to the signifi cant 
challenge in early fault detection and the prevention of motor failure 
 surrounding the stator windings. This challenge is further intensifi ed in 
higher voltage machines, where the fault-to-failure time frame becomes 
much shorter. The stator fault zone is identifi ed as the health and quality of 
the insulation between the turns and phases of the individual turns and 
coils inside the motor.
Failure Mechanisms
The likely mechanisms of a stator-winding fault are either a turn-to-turn, 
phase-to-phase, or turn-to-ground short. A turn-to-turn short is identifi ed as 
a short of one or more windings in a coil. This can develop into a very low 
impedance loop of wire, which acts as a shorted secondary of a current trans-
former. This results in excessive current fl ow through the shorted loop, creat-
ing intense heat and insulation damage. Due to the nature of a random 
wound design, a shorted turn could occur with much higher impedance, 
allowing the motor to run for extended periods of time before eventually 
destroying the coil with the high currents. As a result, it is not unusual to 
fi nd random wound motors still running with bad stator windings. Form-
wound coils however, do not exhibit high turn impedances and will there-
fore heat up quickly following the presence of a turn-to-turn short. A 
phase-to-phase short is identifi ed as a short of one or more phases to another 
phase. This fault can be quite damaging due to the possibility of very large 
voltage potential existing between phases at the location of the short.
Analysis
The big controversy, which surrounds the stator fault zone, is whether tech-
nology can give ample warning of an impending stator-winding failure. 
A motor will develop a turn-to-turn, phase-to-phase, or ground short over 
FIGURE 10.24

Motors and Generators 
623
its life. The goal of any test, when faced with this type of long-term certainty, 
is to identify the impending conditions, which may be conducive to these 
faults, so the condition can be corrected. If the conditions conducive to faults 
are removed, then a longer life for the motor can be expected. If a turn-
to-turn short has occurred, then preventing a restart of the motor may be the 
best thing at that point in the troubleshooting effort. Again, if you wait until 
the turn-to-turn short has occurred before you test the motor, you have 
waited too long.
A surge comparison test set, or PdMA’s MCE test instrument, shown in 
Figure 10.25, applies a high-frequency AC signal and a low-voltage DC signal 
to the stator windings to perform stator analysis. From these signals, induc-
tance and resistance measurements are taken for comparison between like 
coils and historical data. When testing a three-phase AC induction motor, 
comparison between the three phases is the most powerful tool. When test-
ing a DC motor, only a single phase exists and comparison to historical test 
data or identical motors would be effective. Inductance is a highly sensitive 
parameter and is infl uenced by many variables within the motor. Rotor con-
dition, air gap fl ux, frame construction (iron or aluminum), and winding 
condition are a few of the variables. The most infl uential variable on the 
inductance reading is the winding condition. Specifi cally the number of 
turns is a squared value in the overall inductance equation as seen below:

Although it is our goal to prevent a turn-to-turn short from occurring, you 
can see that a loss of a single turn in a stator winding will have a dramatic 
effect on the overall inductance of one or more phases based on the coil con-
fi guration. In our effort to identify the conditions that are conducive to a 
turn-to-turn short, we can use other variables in the equation to identify 
anomalies, which could create stator problems.
Stator faults often end up as a turn-to-turn short, but begin as something 
else. An example is a motor with excessive vibration, which results in wind-
ing movement, friction, and eventually worn insulation between the wind-
ing turns. Another example is rotor defects, which create intense heat on the 
winding surface and eventually create weakened turn insulation or even a 
ground fault. Core iron defects, such as shorted laminations, will also create 
additional heat, airfl ow disturbance, and elevated vibration due to imbal-
anced magnetic fi elds and air gap fl ux. What infl uence do these situations 
have on stator inductance? Other than vibration, rotor defects and air gap 
fl ux anomalies have a direct impact on the permeability ( m) of the stator 
windings. Changes in m due to a stator core defect will create changes in 
inductance related to a specifi c group of coils located near the defect. Changes 
in m due to rotor defects will have a varying infl uence on the stator induc-
tance as the rotor position changes. A quick comparison of the inductance 
and inductive imbalance values between the three phases or to historical 
data will indicate changes in these variables and prompt further action or 
testing to be performed in an effort to prevent the turn-to-turn short.
Stator analysis may be performed by evaluating the phase relationship of 
voltage and current for each of the three phases of an AC induction motor. 
These values are used to determine the impedance of each phase and dis-
play them as an impedance imbalance. Any change in the real or reactive 
component of one phase that is not duplicated on another phase will indi-
cate a change that needs to be investigated. One of the hurdles involved in 
this type of testing is acquiring this dynamic data at a load substantial 
enough to allow these values to be affected by the condition of the windings 
and not the design. An unloaded motor may run with a current imbalance. 
This creates variations in the phase impedance, which duplicates indications 
of a stator fault. Therefore, it is important to have approximately 70% load or 
more to remove the design impact on these values. Testing should not stop 
at <70% load, but you must use the test data as comparison values only.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Switching transient: Switching of power equipment can cause a transient 
voltage to be generated due to the stored energy contained in the circuit 
inductances (L) and capacitances (C). The size and duration of the transient 
depends on the value of inductance and capacitance and the waveform 
applied. Examples of switching surges are fault clearing, capacitor switch-
ing, and switching of inductive loads on and off. Damage from transient 
overvoltages can be immediate or latent. The latent damage occurs when 
equipment or components are severely stressed by repeated transient over-
voltages or by a single transient overvoltage condition, but not to the point of 
immediate failure. Each exposure reduces the ability of the equipment or 
component’s ability to withstand additional stress. At some later time, the 
equipment or component fails unexpectedly without apparent cause due to 
its weakened nature from previous transients. This latent effect may not 
become apparent for some time.
Interruptions: Power interruptions are a complete loss of power lasting for 
cycles, seconds, minutes, hours, or days (Figure 12.6). A variety of factors can 
cause power interruptions, such as tripping of the main circuit breaker due 
to a fault, malfunction or failure of equipment, or operation of protective 
devices in response to faults that occur due to acts of nature or accidents, or 
other anomalies in the power supply. These interruptions may cause loss of 
computer memory, equipment shutdown/failure, hardware damage, and 
productivity loss.
Frequency variations: A frequency variation is a deviation from a prescribed 
input frequency range such as 60 Hz (Figure 12.7). This deviation can be either 
higher or lower than normal. Sudden changes in load, switching of power

between utility and on-site generator, utility generator malfunctions, or mis-
match between generation and load can cause such variations.
Harmonics: Harmonics are voltages or currents at frequencies that are 
 integer multiples of 60 Hz frequency (120, 180, 240, 300 Hz, etc.). They are des-
ignated by their harmonic number or multiple of the fundamental frequency. 
For example, a harmonic with a frequency of 180 Hz—(three times the 60 Hz 
fundamental frequency) is called the third harmonic. As shown in Figure 
12.8, harmonics superimpose themselves on the fundamental waveform, 
distort it, and change its waveform. In industrial power systems, for example, 
15%, 20%, or 25% total harmonic current distortion (THD) may be experi-
enced. THD can be determined by calculating the square root of the sum of 
the squares of all harmonics, divided by the nominal 60 Hz value. This yields

a  root-mean-square (rms) value of distortion as a percentage of the 60 Hz 
waveform. Note, odd-order harmonic currents are additive in the common 
neutral of a three-phase system, whereas the even-order harmonics cancel 
out to zero. The odd-order harmonic currents such as the third and all odd 
multiples of the third harmonic (9th, 15th, etc.) are equal and in phase for a 
 three-phase, four-wire system. Therefore, they add in the neutral. Other odd 
harmonics (5th, 7th, 11th, etc.) are also additive, although not fully since they 
are equal but not exactly in phase. Mathematically, the total is a vector sum 
of the three-phase harmonic currents. The phase angles between the three-
phase harmonic currents results in partial addition and partial  cancellation. 
Therefore, the total neutral current for these harmonics is more than any one 
harmonic phase current, but less than three times any  harmonic phase  current. 
Whereas for the second harmonic and all even harmonics (fourth, sixth, eighth, 
etc.), currents are not in phase and the sum of the  positive and negative neu-
tral currents equals to zero for a three-phase,  four-wire system. Harmonics are 
caused by nonlinear loads, that is loads in which the current waveform does 
not conform to the waveform of applied voltage. All equipment operating on 
the principle of ferromagnetic induction (lighting  ballasts, lifting magnets, 
solenoids, motors, etc.) produces some degree of harmonics. A prime example 
of a device that produces harmonics is a power converter such as a rectifi er 
that draws current in only a portion of each cycle. Other devices, such as those 
which change impedance with applied voltage, also produce harmonics. 
These include saturated transformers and gaseous discharge lighting, such as 
fl uorescent, mercury arc, and high  pressure sodium lights.
Harmonics can cause overloading of conductors and transformers and 
overheating of utilization equipment, such as motors. Odd-numbered triplen 
harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) can especially cause overheating of neutral 
conductors on three-phase, four-wire systems. While the fundamental fre-
quency line currents and other even harmonic currents cancel each other in 
the neutral, the triplen harmonic and other odd harmonic currents are addi-
tive in the neutral. Harmonics also can cause nuisance tripping of molded-
case circuit breakers and power switchgear equipped with solid-state 
trip-sensing units designed to sense peak (as opposed to rms) current. 
As increased amounts of sensitive electronic equipment are being added to 
today’s workplaces, concern for harmonics has escalated as well. Electronic 
equipment miss operation can result from harmonics because much of elec-
tronic circuitry—notably that in which action is instigated by an electronic 
pulsing clock—is triggered by zero crossing on the waveform.
Harmonic currents may contribute to capacitor failure and blown fuses 
on PF improvement capacitors under resonance conditions on the power 
system. Resonance occurs when the power system inductance and capacitance 
come in tune (i.e., equal) with each other at a particular frequency; capacitive 
and inductive reactance are both functions of frequency. Every circuit contain-
ing inductive and capacitive devices has one or more resonant frequencies. 
Resonance can cause very high voltages to appear across elements of the 
power system. At series resonance, minimum circuit impedance occurs at 
the resonant frequency and is equal to the resistance of the circuit since the 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
723
 inductive and capacitive impedances are equal. Series resonance provides 
a low  impedance path for the harmonic currents present in the system.
Figure 12.9 illustrates a typical resonant condition on an arc furnace cir-
cuit containing PF improvement capacitors. The plot of voltage response 
versus frequency models the arc furnace as a harmonic current source 
of varying frequency. A resonance peak occurs at very close to 300 Hz, or 
the fi fth harmonic. This harmonic source develops excessive voltage at the 
capacitor  terminals, resulting in extremely high current fl ow through 
the capacitor.
Voltage imbalance: A voltage imbalance is a long term, steady state problem. 
It is expressed as a percent, i.e., the maximum deviation of voltage from the 
average of three-phase voltages, multiplied by 100, divided by the average of 
the voltages. Voltage imbalances are caused by unbalanced phase loading 
conditions, defective transformers, and ground faults in ungrounded or resis-
tive grounded systems. These imbalances usually are caused by large single-
phase loads. They cause premature failures of motors and transformers due 
to overheating. Voltage imbalances only affect three-phase applications.
Electrical noise: Electrical noise is a low-voltage, low-current, high-frequency 
signal that rides a 60 Hz sine wave, distorting it. Noise may be caused by any 
of the following: RFI, EMI, harmonics from nonlinear loads, and the like. Even 
though microprocessor-based equipment is grounded in accordance with 
National Electric Code (NEC) requirements, some continue to have failures, 
execution and reading errors, and unpredictable and intermittent operations 
because of electrical noise. Some manufacturers of microprocessor-based 
equipment recommend electrical separation to minimize the effects of electri-
cal noise, i.e., to locate the microprocessor-based equipment and/or data lines 
not too close to large power apparatus such as transformers, motors, etc.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Two types of electrical noise can occur in a power distribution system. 
They are normal mode (line-to-neutral, L–N or  line-to-line) noise and CM 
(neutral-to-ground, N–G) noise.
Normal mode noise is measured between the phase (hot) and neutral 
lines or phase-to-phase. CM noise is a potential difference that occurs 
between any or all current-carrying conductors and the grounding conduc-
tor or earth. In the three-phase, grounded-wye power supplies typical of 
large computer systems, these disturbances also can be potential differ-
ences between neutral and ground. Some computer-based loads are sensi-
tive to excessive levels of voltage potential between the neutral and 
grounding conductors. A ground is used to reference the electronic logic in 
equipment and should be stable. Equipment manufacturers sometimes 
specify acceptable limits for neutral to ground voltage, for example, one 
volt peak to peak. CM disturbances can be generated by a ground potential 
difference between elements of the computer or remote peripherals con-
nected to the computer. This type of disturbance is infl uenced by several 
factors, including the system confi guration and the impedance of the 
grounding system. Both of these factors generally are beyond the direct 
control of the user, except in the construction of a new facility. However, 
CM noise can be suppressed by the use of an isolation transformer. 
Equalizing ground potentials is often diffi cult due to the broad frequency 
band involved in wiring resonances. However, proper computer system 
grounding, including a signal reference grid (SRG), has been found to be 
effective against most CM disturbances. CM noise on the primary of the 
transformer that appears as normal mode noise on the secondary is com-
monly referred to as transverse mode or sometimes as intercoupling or dif-
ferential mode (DM) noise. CM transient voltages that appear on the 
transformer primary winding will be coupled through the transformer 
interwinding capacitance, appearing across the secondary winding as 
normal mode voltages. Electrical noise typically occurs in the RF MHz 
range. It also may occur at frequencies below MHz range. The 60 Hz (power) 
grounding system often is not effective for conducting RF signals to the 
common reference point grounding electrode. In some cases, computers 
and peripherals are themselves responsible for generating noise distur-
bances. A properly designed power grounding system has suffi ciently low 
impedance at 60 Hz to maintain enclosures, raceways, and all grounded 
metals at the same voltage potential (ground reference). But the 60 Hz 
ground system is unable to provide this equalization at higher frequencies 
because of the increased impedance caused by inductive reactance and the 
skin effect. (Skin effect is known as the tendency of current to fl ow more at 
the surface of the conductor than its center, thereby increasing the AC resis-
tance of the conductor). The inductive reactance at a frequency of 30 MHz 
is 500,000 times as great as that of the same conductor when the applied 
voltage is at 60 Hz. At microprocessor switching speeds (over 1 to 30 MHz), 
current penetration in the copper conductor is less than at 60 Hz, with the 
result that the effective impedance between one point and another is 
 pronounced. Also, as frequency rises, the wavelength proportionally

tortion. Consequently, the long grounding conductors used in the ground-
ing systems designed to meet NEC requirements become ineffective for 
grounding of high-frequency systems. Short returns are always recom-
mended for fast-rise circuits to provide effective signal returns at system 
signal frequencies.

12.3 Origins of PQ Problems and Harmonics
Power disturbances can originate from many sources external and internal 
to a facility’s electrical power distribution system. External sources are
Power system faults
• 
Lightning
• 
Switching
• 
Surges
• 
Accidents involving electric power lines and feeders
• 
Examples of internal sources are
Line and capacitor switching
• 
Motor starting or switching of large inductive loads
• 
Harmonic producing loads (linear and nonlinear (solid-state and 
• 
electronic) loads)
The mechanisms involved in generating electrical disturbances often deter-
mine whether occurrence of disturbances is random or repeatable, unpredict-
able, or easy to fi nd. Untrained users often attribute power disturbances to the 
utility source. However, recent Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
studies indicated that most (up to 80%) electronic system malfunctions attrib-
utable to power disturbances are the result of electrical wiring and grounding 
errors, or interactions of loads within the facility’s distribution system.
A brief description of some of the major sources of power disturbances 
follows:
Power system faults: Power system faults can cause a momentary voltage 
reduction to a complete loss of power lasting for a few cycles, seconds, min-
utes, hours, or days. Power system faults may be classifi ed as temporary or 
permanent. Usually the temporary faults are confi ned to overhead distribu-
tion lines where a line may suffer a momentary fault which will open the 
circuit breaker. However, the circuit breaker will reclose immediately to 
restore the circuit. Permanent faults are confi ned usually to underground 
feeders. Due to their location, the detection and repair of these types of faults 
require a considerable amount of time. Also, the power system faults may 
result from power apparatus failure such as transformers, circuit breakers, 
etc. which require a longer time to repair or replace.
Lightning surges: Direct lightning strikes to the power system conductors 
cause overvoltages near their points of impact. Direct hits inject the total 
lightning surge into the system. As a result, current amplitudes can range 
from a few thousand amperes to a few hundred thousand amperes. The rapid 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
727
change of current through the impedance of the conductors  produces 
a high voltage drop, which causes secondary fl ashover to ground. This 
diverts current even in the absence of an intentional diverter. Lightning 
strikes also can activate lightning arrestors and/or surge arrestors. A fl ash-
over of line insulators can trip a breaker, with reclosing delayed by several 
cycles, causing a power interruption. The power system also can be affected 
indirectly by lightning. These effects include overvoltages in conductors and 
ground potential rises in grounding grids or the earth.
Load switching and surges: Load switching forms a transient disturbance 
whenever a circuit containing capacitance and inductance, such as capacitors, 
starting motors, or switching feeders, is switched on or off. In these circuits, the 
currents and voltages do not reach their fi nal value instantaneously. The sever-
ity of such disturbances depends on the power level of the load being switched 
and on the available short-circuit current of the power system. Switching large 
loads on or off can produce long-duration voltage changes beyond the imme-
diate transient response of the circuit. More complex  switching can produce 
surge voltages reaching 10 times the normal circuit voltages, involving energy 
levels determined by the power rating of the elements being switched. Also, 
energizing loads, such as large motors, may cause voltage dip that can affect 
operation of microprocessor-based equipment.
Linear and nonlinear loads: The power system harmonic problem is an 
old problem and, in many instances in the past, we have been able to go 
around it and reduce its effects. The harmonic producing linear loads are 
devices such as transformers, generators, motors, electromagnetic ballasts, 
and  saturated magnetic devices that have been around a long time. These are 
discussed in more detail in Section 12.4. The nonlinear loads are generally 
classifi ed as those devices that are electronic and solid-state devices used in 
power conversion and control. It is clear that nonlinear loads draw nonsinu-
soidal currents from the power system, even if the power system has a per-
fect sinusoidal waveshape. These currents produce nonsinusoidal voltage 
drops in the system’s source impedance which distorts the sine wave pro-
duced by the power source. A typical nonlinear load is a direct current (DC) 
power supply with capacitor-input fi lter. They are used in most computers 
and draw current only at the peaks of the voltage sine wave. Nonlinear loads 
typically result in harmonic distortions (HDs) in the power system. These 
loads can be broadly classifi ed into four categories as follows.
 
1. Power electronic devices: Power electronic devices are being employed in 
small appliances to huge converters on the transmission system. Typical 
applications of power electronics include switch-mode power supplies 
(SMPS), adjustable speed drives (ASDs), electronic ballasts, and the like.
 
2. Saturatable devices: Most saturatable devices are transformers which 
generate harmonics due to the nonlinearity of the transformer excita-
tion. These harmonics are small unless the transformer is overexcited 
due to high voltage magnitudes.

728 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
 
3. Arcing devices: Arcing devices are used most commonly in fl uores-
cent, high and low pressure sodium and mercury-vapor lamps. 
Other types of these devices include arc furnaces or arc welders.
 
4. Electrostatic discharges (ESDs): An ESD buildup results from a rub-
bing action between two materials (solid or liquid) of different sur-
face energy characteristics. This is due to an absence of a conductive 
path between the two materials. The ESD is quickly released when 
a conductive path (discharge arc) is established. Such discharges 
can be harmful to semiconductor devices in sensitive electronic 
equipment. Discharge voltages often range from 5 to 40 kV.
Grounding design and installation: Improperly grounded systems which have 
multiple ground points are common causes of PQ disturbances. Grounding 
systems which do not have suffi ciently low ground impedance do not allow 
the proper amount of current fl ow necessary for the operation of the circuit 
protection devices, thereby compromising the safety of personnel and 
 equipment. Such systems also cause failures in electronic equipment due to 
leakage currents. Leakage currents created by power line noise, coupled with 
 high-ground impedances, cause voltage to develop on the ground conductor 
that can trigger a failure in electronic equipment. A ground system with multi-
ground points can create multiground loops and impose stray currents on the 
logic chips of microprocessors. Therefore, it is essential that the design and 
installation of earth grounds and equipment grounds should be done carefully. 
Since the ground system also serves as an equal potential reference between 
peripherals, an improperly designed ground can affect microprocessor logic 
and inject unwanted signals. The logic circuitry of a microprocessor uses the 
ground system as a zero conductor. See Section 12.7 for a more detailed discus-
sion on grounding design and installation.
Wiring design and installation:
Wiring design and installation problems can be classifi ed as follows:
 
1. Problems involving the hot, neutral, and ground wires
 
2. Missing connections, improper connections, loose connections, open 
grounds, N–G shorts, two hot wires in an outlet, reversed polarity
 
3. Lack of an isolated ground (IG) receptacle when called for
Because microprocessors use the ground wire as the zero-voltage reference, 
stray currents imposed upon it can change information and damage micropro-
cessor components. Additional power distribution problems can occur because 
many pieces of equipment typically are connected together through the build-
ing’s grounding system, including conduit or data cables. If the ground paths of 
individual pieces of equipment are not isolated from one another, currents car-
ried on one can affect another’s operation. When a piece of equipment is plugged 
into a standard wall receptacle without an IG designation, its ground wire is 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
729
immediately connected to every other piece of equipment in the building by 
means of building conduit. This is similar to the manner in which a large radio 
antenna picks up radio signals it was never meant to receive. Data cables are 
extremely sensitive to such cross talk.
12.4  Characteristics of Typical Linear 
and Nonlinear Loads
The harmonic loads may be classifi ed as linear and nonlinear loads. The 
linear loads that produce harmonics are iron core devices which operate in 
the nonlinear (saturated) region of the iron core. Also, depending on the 
winding pitch, motors and generators may produce harmonics. These sources 
(loads) have been around since the early days of power systems, but the har-
monics produced by these devices have been manageable. The traditional 
(established) sources of harmonics include the following:
Tooth ripple or ripples in the waveform arising from the rapid pul-
• 
sations and oscillations of the fi eld fl ux caused by movement of 
the poles in front of the projecting armature teeth cause harmonic 
output. This tooth ripple causes fl ux distortion in synchronous 
machines.
Variations in air gap reluctance over the synchronous machine pole 
• 
pitch set up a continuous variation in fl ux, which permeates to the 
waveshape, and leaves harmonics as a result.
Flux distortion in the synchronous machine may be due to load effects. 
• 
Sharp variations in the load result in sudden changes in machine speed 
without changes in fl ux, thus setting up a distorted waveshape.
Generation of nonsinusoidal emf’s are due to nonsinusoidal distri-
• 
bution of the fl ux in the air gap of synchronous machines.
Limited transformer current harmonics, primarily third harmonic, 
• 
occur at no load.
Imposition of small and limited amount of nonsinusoidal currents, 
• 
although input voltages are pure sine wave, occur in networks con-
taining nonlinearity. Typical of these nonlinearities are welders, arc 
furnaces, voltage controllers, frequency converters, etc.
To a lesser extent, but of importance is the fact that a drastic change in the 
design philosophy of all power equipment and load equipment has taken place. 
In the past, manufacturers tended towards underrating or overdesigning most 
equipment. Now, in order to be competitive, power devices and equipment 
must be critically designed. In the case of iron core devices, this means that the 
operating points are more into the nonlinear characteristics, resulting in a sharp 
rise in harmonics from the established power equipment and load equipment.

730 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Today, however the application of electronic equipment continues to change 
the electrical environment in the power distribution system of most commer-
cial and industrial facility. In the past, the most common loads found in 
 electrical distribution systems were linear loads such as motors, incandescent 
lighting, and electric heating. Although these loads still exist in modern facili-
ties, other loads—primarily electronic—that have nonlinear load  characteristics 
represent a large percentage of the total load. Because of the proliferation of 
nonlinear loads, harmonic currents have increased signifi cantly in electrical 
distribution systems. Since the electrical distribution systems in most facili-
ties were designed to match the characteristics of linear loads (i.e., nearly 
sinusoidal waveforms), the application of nonlinear loads have caused seri-
ous problems such as overheating of conductors, transformers,  inadvertent 
circuit breaker tripping, capacitor failures, and malfunction of electronic 
equipment. The nonlinear loads consume substantial amounts of energy and 
thus have a greater impact compared to the linear loads on a facility’s electric 
power distribution system. Linear loads have an impedance characteristic 
which is basically constant over time with applied voltage. If a sinusoidal 
voltage is applied to these loads, the current drawn also is sinusoidal.
In contrast, nonlinear electronic loads do not draw sinusoidal current. The 
applied power to these loads is either rectifi ed by a diode bridge or the device is 
turned on and off with switching components such as SCRs, triacs, or  transistors. 
Figure 12.10 shows the current waveforms of linear load (sinusoidal) and recti-
fi er (SMPS) load. In Figure 12.10, the sine waveform is representative of heaters, 
incandescent and motor type loads, the pulse waveform is representative of 
electronic loads that draw current in pulses (i.e., nonsinusoidal waveform), or 
draw current for the portion of each cycle by turning on and off. The nonsinu-
soidal loads do not draw current for the entire cycle but rather draw current in

small period per cycle or turn on at a specifi c point in the cycle. The current 
drawn by the electronic loads is in abrupt transitions which interact with 
system impedance causing voltage loss and transients (impulses).
Some electronic loads are constant power loads, such as SMPS, and for 
these loads a decrease in voltage within the operating range will cause an 
increase in current to maintain constant power. Also, the harmonic currents 
of the load interact with the impedance of the distribution system thereby 
causing harmonic voltage drops. When the distribution system impedance is 
high, the harmonic voltage drops are high and the harmonic currents for the 
nonsinusoidal loads are lower. When the distribution system impedance is 
low, the harmonic voltage drops are low and harmonic current for the non-
linear loads are high. The nonlinear loads when combined with high current 
inrush and high distribution system impedance tend to cause severe voltage 
dips and voltage waveform distortion. Under these conditions, the constant 
power electronic loads attempt to compensate by increasing current draw. 
The increased current draw interacts with the impedance of the distribution 
system and adds to the voltage dip, and if the voltage dip is severe enough 
loads throughout the distribution system will crash. In addition to producing 
line voltage drops, the third harmonic currents (odd-order triplen harmonics) 
do not cancel out and fl ow in the neutral circuit of a three-phase, four-wire 
system. As a result, these currents return back to the power source over 
the neutral conductor. These currents can be higher than the phase currents 
and, therefore, create new concerns over the adequacy of the neutral of the 
three-phase power supply system.
To cope with harmonics problems caused by nonlinear loads, load charac-
teristics of system harmonics must be studied and understood. The load 
characteristics can, for the most part, be determined from an examination of 
the load response to a distorted voltage waveform at load terminals.
12.4.1 Voltage and Current Characteristics of Nonlinear Loads
12.4.1.1 HD Terminology
The nonsinusoidal periodic waveform of nonlinear loads can be represented 
through Fourier analysis as the sum of a DC component and sine waves of 
various amplitudes and phase displacement from some relative angle. The 
sine waves all have frequencies which are multiple of the fundamental fre-
quency of 60 Hz. The voltage and current waveforms can then be represented 
as the sum of a DC component and sine waves with a fundamental frequency

The voltage and current equations represent sine waves that are multiples 
of a fundamental frequency, and are called harmonics. The effective value

The nonlinearity (i.e., distortion) of the waveform can be determined in

of the fundamental current. The THD is expressed as a percentage of the

12.4.1.2 Types of Nonlinear Loads
Four types of nonlinear power electronic devices are increasingly being 
used in commercial facilities. These are fl uorescent lighting, ASDs, SMPS, 
and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). A brief description of voltage and 
current characteristics of each is detailed below.
Fluorescent lighting: Fluorescent lighting has overtaken incandescent light-
ing as the most popular and widely used lighting system. Light in fl uorescent 
lamps is generated by gas discharge. The lamps require a ballast to provide 
proper starting and operating voltages and to limit current during lamp 
operation. Two types of ballasts are used with fl uorescent lamps: magnetic 
core–coil and electronic. Both types generate harmonics. Magnetic ballasts 
generate third HD typically in the range of 13%–20%. In contrast, recent tests 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
733
conducted by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory show that HD generated by 
currently available electronic ballasts can vary from 5% to well over 33% of 
the fundamental current, depending on their design. In fact, some types of 
electronic ballasts generate less harmonic currents than magnetic ballasts. 
Most manufacturers are holding HD to levels well below those recommended 
by ANSI (THD less than 32%). In summary, the THD of electronic ballast is 
comparable to magnetic ballasts, electronic ballast have wide range of indi-
vidual harmonic currents, and use much less power than magnetic ballasts.
Variable frequency drives (VFDs): Most VFDs contain a front-end rectifi er, 
DC link, and an inverter, operating together with a control system. The recti-
fi er converts the three-phase AC input to DC voltage. Depending on the type 
of system, a reactor, a capacitor, or a combination of these are used to smooth 
the DC signal. The inverter circuit uses the DC voltage to create a variable 
frequency AC voltage to control the speed of the AC motor. The VFDs are 
also referred to as ASDs or variable speed drives (VSDs). The characteristic 
harmonics for a VFD or ASD are based on the number of rectifi ers (pulse 
number) in a circuit and can be determined by the following:
 
h = (n × p) ± 1 
where
h is the harmonic order
n is an integer (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …)
p is the number of pulses of rectifi er
For example, using the above equation, the six-pulse rectifi er shown in Figure 
12.11a will create characteristic harmonics of 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 
and so on. The degree and magnitude of the harmonics is function of the 
drive design and the interrelationship of the nonlinear load with the con-
nected distribution system impedance. The power source line impedance 
ahead of the controller will determine the magnitude and amplitude of har-
monic currents and voltages refl ected back into the distribution system as is 
shown in Figure 12.11b. The distorted current refl ected through the distribu-
tion impedance causes a voltage drop or harmonic voltage distortion. This 
relationship is proportional to the distribution system available fault current 
and to the distribution system impedance.
The two most commonly used AC drives are: voltage source inverter (VSI) 
drives and current source inverter (CSI) drives. Each is briefl y described below.
VSI drives: VSI drives employ a large capacitor in the DC link to provide a 
relatively constant voltage to the inverter. The inverter then breaks up this 
DC voltage to provide the variable frequency AC voltage for the motor. Most 
inverter drives use pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques to improve 
the quality of the output voltage waveform. Typical applications of these 
drives are motors up to 100 hp.

734 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
CSI drives: CSI drives are typically used for larger motor applications where 
custom design can be justifi ed. The DC link consists of a large choke to keep 
the DC current relatively constant. The inverter then breaks up this 
current waveform to provide the variable frequency AC signal for the motor.
PF characteristics of VFDs also can be very important because the application 
of capacitors for PF correction can create special problems, including harmonic 
resonance and transient voltage magnifi cation. The displacement component 
of the PF is associated with the angle between the voltage and the current. 
Without any distortion, the PF is equal to the displacement PF (DPF). Both 
drives have distorted current waveforms, that adds a distortion component to 
the PF (true PF is real power divided by total apparent power).
The distortion, and therefore the PF, can be considerably worse for VSI-type 
drives than for most CSI-type drives. Phase-controlled CSI drives have a very 
poor PF if operated with large rectifi er fi ring delay angles. Transient voltage 
withstand capability is another important characteristic of VFDs. Power semi-
conductor switches that have a peak inverse voltage (PIV) rating of only 1200 V 
are used in many VFDs. On a 480 V distribution system, this PIV rating 
equates to 177% of normal system voltage. In most power semiconductor 
switch assemblies, onboard metal-oxide varistors (MOVs) are utilized for pro-
tection purposes. While the MOVs are effective for many low energy tran-
sients, they can be destroyed by magnifi ed capacitor switching transients if 
not sized correctly. Drive topology and the control system characteristics also

affect the sensitivity of VFDs to transient disturbances. VSI-type drives require 
smoothing of the DC line voltage with a large capacitor for proper operation. 
For protection of inverter components, the DC bus voltage is monitored and 
the drive is tripped when it exceeds a preset level. Momentary interruptions 
or voltage dip on the input voltage can affect drive controls as well. This char-
acteristic is very dependent on the specifi c controls involved, but it is not 
uncommon for voltage dips lasting only a few cycles to cause drives to trip.
SMPS: SMPS generate harmonics due to the switching action of the recti-
fi er bridge which supplies the switching regulator. A DC capacitor provides 
an essentially constant DC voltage for the switching regulator. In order to 
maintain this DC voltage, the capacitor only needs to draw a pulse of current 
near the peak on each sine wave. The resulting current waveform is shown 
in Figure 12.12. The power relationship based on sinusoidal voltage and cur-
rents will not be valid with these waveforms. For one thing, the peak current 
is no longer 1.414 times the rms current. The CF (ratio of peak to rms) for this 
current is much higher and any meter, controls or relay which is sensitive to 
the peak current must take this into account. The current drawn by the SMPS 
contains signifi cant harmonic components. Figure 12.13 shows that the high-
est harmonic component is the third.
Harmonic components in this current also have a dramatic effect on the PF 
of the load. Although the 60 Hz component of the current (fundamental) is in 
phase with the voltage (DPF close to unity), the harmonic components reduce 
the true PF and indirectly reduce the real power available.
12.4.1.3 PF Characteristics of Loads
PF is defi ned as the ratio of real power divided by the apparent (total) power, 
i.e., watts divided by volt-amps (VA). Resistive loads produce unity PF,   however,

where PFDisp is commonly known as the DPF, and (d1 − q1) is known as the PF

true PF and DPF are equal. However, this is not true in the case of nonsinu-
soidal situations because voltages and currents contain harmonics. The aver-
age power for a nonsinusoidal situation can be represented by including the 
signifi cant harmonics such as the third, fi fth, seventh, and so on. We can then

The above equation provides insights into the nature of the true PF of electronic 
(nonlinear) loads, especially single-phase loads. It appears from the above equa-
tion that higher the HD, lower is the true PF even though the DPF can be very 
high. The displacement and true PF relationships are shown in Figure 12.14.
The true PF is calculated for a nonlinear load with distortion (THDI %) as 
shown below:

The true PFs calculated above represent maximum true PFs for nonlinear 
loads. Actual true PF is the product of maximum true PF and DPF, and the 
product can be signifi cantly lower than DPF. The PF comparison shown 
above gives an optimistic picture because harmonic currents actually cause 
more losses per ampere than do fundamental currents.
12.4.1.4 Phase Sequence of Harmonics
In a balanced three-phase power system, the voltages and currents in 
phases a–b–c are shifted in time by ±120° of fundamental. Taking a-phase 
as a reference, we can write an equation for a-phase current as

By examining the above current equations, we see that
The fi rst harmonic (i.e., the fundamental) is positive sequence 
• 
(a–b–c) because phase b lags phase a by 120°, and phase c leads phase 
a by 120° (or lags phase a by 240°)
The second harmonic is negative sequence (a–c–b) because phase b 
• 
leads phase a by 120°, and phase c lags phase a by 120°
The third harmonic is zero sequence because all three phases have 
• 
the same phase angle
The pattern for a balanced system repeats and is shown below as “Phase 
sequence of harmonics in three-phase balanced system.”

742 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
If a system is not balanced, then each harmonic can have positive, negative, 
and zero sequence components. However, in most cases, the pattern shown 
above can be assumed to be valid.
Because of Kirchhoff’s current law, zero sequence currents cannot fl ow into 
a three-wire connection such as a delta transformer winding or a delta-connected 
load. In most cases, systems are fairly well balanced, so that it is common to 
make the same assumption for third harmonics and other triplens. Thus, a delta-
grounded wye transformer at the service point of an industrial facility usually 
blocks the fl ow of triplen harmonic load currents into the power system. 
Unfortunately, the transformer does nothing to block the fl ow of any other har-
monics, such as fi fth, seventh, and so on. Zero sequence currents fl ow through 
neutral or grounding paths. Positive and negative sequence currents sum to 
zero at neutral and grounding points. Another interesting observation can be 
made about zero sequence harmonics. Line-to-line voltages never have zero 
sequence components because, according to Kirchhoff’s voltage law, they always 
sum to zero. For that reason, line-to-line voltages in commercial buildings are 
missing the third harmonic that dominates L–N voltage waveforms. Thus, the V 
THD of line-to-line voltages is often considerably less than for L–N voltages.
12.4.1.5 Harmonic Generating Characteristics
In the past, harmonic currents originated primarily from a few major 
sources, such as arc welders, fl uorescent ballasts and lights, arc furnaces, 
etc. As explained previously, signifi cant harmonics are being generated 
by today’s load equipment such as switching power supplies, solid-state 
 controls, and other sensitive electronic equipment. The harmonics in these 
nonlinear loads cause voltage distortion, poor PF, and stress on supply power 
system equipment. Harmonics from nonsinusoidal loads interact with elec-
trical distribution system impedance, creating heat in electrical distribution 
equipment. Harmonic voltage distortion limits peak applied voltage and 
may increase susceptibility to momentary voltage dropouts.
12.4.1.6 Sensitivity to Harmonics
Most electronic equipment is affected by harmonics because high levels of 
harmonic currents cause problems in the power system that is not designed 
for nonlinear loads. The problems are:
Overloading of the phase and neutral conductors of the power 
• 
distribution system
Overheating of the distribution transformers, where high-frequency 
• 
currents can cause higher losses from eddy currents, magnetic 
hysteresis, and skin effect
Overloading of power sources such as UPS systems and emergency 
• 
generators including generator controls
Poor utilization of available power from the branch circuits because 
• 
of low PF

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
743
Premature failure of PF correction capacitors because of overheating 
• 
by harmonic currents
Flat-topping of the voltage waveform caused by high-peak currents 
• 
which reduce the ride-through capability of the electronic equipment
12.4.1.7 Sensitivity to Voltage Variation
All electronic equipment is generally sensitive to supply voltage variations. For 
example, computer systems can experience performance problems if the follow-
ing voltage thresholds are exceeded: sags greater than −20% rms, spikes greater 
than 100% peak, and swells greater than +10% rms. When assessing the impact 
of voltage variation on electronic equipment, it is helpful to know the related 
voltage waveforms, that is whether they are swell, sag, impulse, or electrical 
noise. The effects of power line voltage variation, resulting from a utility’s power 
system disturbances or interaction of the load and its power source, may appear 
in many forms. Sensitive electronic equipment may cease to operate, errors may 
occur in processing and data transfer, or hardware damage may occur.
12.4.1.8 Sensitivity to Voltage Flicker
Voltage changes which are cyclical in nature (occur in the range of 0.5–30 Hz) 
are commonly referred to as voltage fl icker. Voltage fl icker can be caused by: 
repetitive motor starting, punch presses, large reciprocating compressors, 
resistance welders, and arc furnaces. Voltage fl icker can affect the sensitive 
electronic load equipment, especially if it happens near peak voltage when 
the DC power supply usually draws AC line current.
12.4.1.9 Sensitivity to Noise
All power lines, motors, generators, and other current handling devices radi-
ate magnetic fi elds of varying strengths (electric noise). In addition to the 
above sources of electrical noise, fault produced transients, surges, and 
ground potential rises also produce unwanted magnetic fi elds. The gener-
ated and radiated magnetic fi elds couple across to other cables (both power 
and communications) and affect sensitive electronic equipment. The level of 
electrical noise that is considered acceptable depends on the signal level and 
accuracy requirements of the load equipment. Separation of the electrical 
noise sources and load signal cables, proper grounding, and proper cable 
confi guration are some of the techniques for reducing noise.
12.5  Effects of Harmonic on Power System 
Equipment and Loads
The HD of concern here is the nonfundamental periodic voltage resulting 
from the steady state operation of nonlinear elements connected to the 

744 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
power distribution system. This periodic voltage often, but not always, 
consists of harmonics of the power system fundamental frequency. The 
effect of voltage distortion may be divided into three general categories: 
(1) insulation stress due to voltage effects, (2) thermal stress due to current 
fl ow, and (3) load disruption. Load disruption is defi ned as objectionable 
abnormal operation or failure caused by voltage distortion. While this def-
inition is general enough to include such items as torques generated in 
electromechanical devices, load disruptions appear to b e limited to the 
various types of solid-state loads. In this section we offer a discussion on 
general concepts involved in evaluating the effects of harmonics on power 
apparatus, to provide quantitative analysis of the effects and to identify 
potential problems.
12.5.1 Basic Concepts on Effects of Harmonics

The rms value of the voltage distortion does not provide peak voltage levels

measure for assessing HD on insulation is magnitude factor (MF), which is 
given by the following equation:

The distortion factors, current, voltage (rms and peak), and telephone infl uence 
are utilized to describe the quantitative effect of the harmonics on electric loads 
and other apparatus. For example, the CFD is useful in quantifying the copper 
losses in a constant resistance load, the TIF to quantify telephone interference, 
MF in assessing dielectric stress, etc. In general, the diversity of the effects of 
harmonics makes it extremely unlikely that any one measure of voltage distor-
tion will adequately describe all effects. A better approach is to identify the 
sensitivities of apparatus performance to distortion factors, and thereby, iden-
tify the relative usefulness of these parameters. The effects of harmonics on 
thermal stress, insulation stress, and load disruption are discussed as follows.
12.5.1.1 Thermal Stress
In general, the presence of harmonic current increases the losses and thus the 
thermal stress of the equipment. The losses are copper losses, iron losses, and 
dielectric losses. In a given power equipment, one or more of above losses may 
determine the thermal stress of the device. These losses can be computed 
as follows:
Copper losses: The copper losses (PC) can be computed with the following

where Ih is the peak value of the hth harmonic current, Rh is the resistance of 
the apparatus at the hth harmonic.
In cases where resistance of the apparatus is constant (independent of 
frequency), the copper losses can be written in terms of the CDF as follows;

As shown in the equation above, the CFD determines the increase of copper 
losses due to the presence of harmonics. In general, however, the resistance 
of power apparatus increases with frequency because of the skin effect. The 
impact of skin effect on harmonic losses becomes more important in large 
diameter conductors and deep bar induction motors.
Iron losses: Iron losses are made up of (1) hysteresis loss and (2) eddy 
current loss. These losses are given by the following formulas:
Hysteresis loss (Ph) is a function of magnetic material used and frequency of 
the current. For a given magnetic core, the hysteresis loss is equal to
 
h

where
ah is a constant dependent on core dimensions
f is the frequency of electric current
Bm is the maximum value of the magnetic fl ux density
v is an exponent dependent on the core material (for commonly used 
materials, v = 1.5–2.5)
Eddy current loss (Pe) depends on core material (resistivity of core), thickness 
of lamination, frequency of electric currents, and magnetic fl ux density. For 
a given magnetic circuit the eddy current losses are given by

therefore

The total iron loss is a nonlinear function of frequency and maximum 
magnetic fl ux density. For a given voltage harmonic, the frequency is known 
and the maximum magnetic fl ux density is proportional to the harmonic 
current. The constant of proportionality depends on coil and magnetic core 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance

design. The equation for iron loss is valid for a sinusoidal excitation of the 
power apparatus of frequency f. In case the excitation source is polluted 
with harmonics, one can cautiously use the equation for iron loss to com-
pute the iron loss for each harmonic and add the contributions. This pro-
cedure (superposition) is correct only for linear apparatus. Because of 
magnetic saturation and magnetic hysteresis, magnetic circuits are not 
exactly linear systems. However, for normally encountered operating con-
ditions and level of harmonics, superposition can be used as a reasonable 
approximation.
Dielectric losses: The dielectric losses are applicable to cables and capacitors 
and at a given harmonic, h, are given by the following equation

where
w is the fundamental angular frequency
Vh is the peak value of the hth harmonic voltage
C is the capacitance of the apparatus
(tan d)h is the dielectric loss factor at the hth harmonic
12.5.1.2 Insulation Stress
Insulation stress primarily depends on instantaneous voltage magnitude and 
voltage rate of increase secondarily. The presence of voltage harmonics can 
result in an increase of the crest value of the voltage and thus increased insu-
lation stress. This increase is not of concern for most power system apparatus 
because they are insulated for much higher voltage levels than those usually 
encountered from harmonics. Capacitor banks, however, are very sensitive 
to overvoltages and must be protected against overvoltages resulting from 
harmonics. A special discussion is provided later in this section. The voltage 
rate of increase is important in switchgear and it is discussed in this section 
also. An area of possible concern is the effect of voltage distortion on surge 
protective devices, including the sparkover and recovery of gapped surge 
arresters.
12.5.1.3 Load Disruption
Load disruption is defi ned as objectionable abnormal operation or failure 
caused by voltage distortion. Many electronic equipment are susceptible to 
load disruption because their normal operation depends on the existence of 
a sinusoidal voltage source. The effects of the harmonics on electronic equip-
ment are discussed later in this section. Load disruption also includes 
decreases of useful magnetic electromagnetic torque in electric machinery 
because of the presence of harmonics. Specifi cally, current harmonics 

748 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
 circulating in the armature of electric machinery may generate pulsating or 
 constant electromagnetic torques. Pulsating torques result in equipment 
wear and shortening of equipment life. Constant torques, in most cases, 
reduce the useful electromagnetic torque and, result in reduced effi ciency.
12.5.2 Harmonic Effects on Power System Equipment
12.5.2.1 Transformers
The effects of harmonics on transformers are
Increased copper losses
• 
Increased iron losses
• 
Possibly resonance between transformers
• 
windings and line capacitance
• 
Insulation stress
• 
Neutral overheating due to triplen harmonics
• 
The copper losses and iron losses in the presence of harmonics can be com-
puted with the general equations presented in Section 12.5.1.1. The applica-
tion of general equations given in Section 12.5.1.1 assumes that the transformer 
is a linear device which it is not. However, for normal, operating conditions 
and normal levels of harmonics, this is a reasonable approximation. Similarly, 
an approximate expression for total hysteresis losses can be determined by 
using the equations given in Section 12.5.1.1. However, the increase of hyster-
esis losses due to harmonics is only a fraction of the eddy current losses.
Voltage harmonics result in higher transformer voltage, therefore higher 
insulation stress. This is not a problem since most transformers are insu-
lated for much higher voltage levels than the overvoltages due to usual 
levels of harmonics. There is a certain degree of interaction between volt-
age and current harmonics for transformers designed to operate near the 
saturation point (knee of the saturation curve). It is possible a small level 
of voltage harmonic to generate a high level of current harmonics. This 
phenomenon depends on specifi c harmonic and phase relationship to the 
fundamental. To address the overheating of transformers due to harmon-
ics, the ANSI/IEEE published a standard C57.110-1998, “Recommended 
practice for establishing transformer capability when supplying nonsinu-
soidal load currents,” which was reaffi rmed in 2004. This standard estab-
lishes methods for determining derating factors for transformer capability 
to carry nonsinusoidal load currents.
In 1990, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) established the method for testing 
transformers that serve nonlinear loads. The UL test addresses coil heating 
due to nonlinear loads and overheating of the neutral conductor by assign-
ing a “K“ factor to the transformer. The K-factor is meant to apply to trans-
formers serving general nonlinear loads. UL has devised the K-factor method 
for labeling and rating the  ability of dry-type transformers to withstand the

effects of harmonics. The K-factor rating indicates the transformer’s ability 
to tolerate the additional heating caused by harmonics. The K-factor is 
based on the methodology similar to that discussed in the ANSI/IEEE 
C57.110 standard. The K-factor can be calculated as the sum of the product 
of each harmonic current squared and that harmonic number squared for 
all harmonics from the fundamental to the highest  harmonic of conse-
quence. When K-factor is multiplied by the stray losses of the transformer, 
the result represents the total stray losses in the transformer caused by 
harmonic currents. To obtain the total load losses, the total stray losses are 
then added to the load losses. It should be obvious that the K-factor for 
linear loads (absence of harmonics) is 1. Also, the K-factor does not mean 
that the transformer can eliminate harmonics. Harmonics increase heating 
losses in all transformers, and some of these losses are deep within the 
core and windings and some are closer to the surface. Oil-filled trans-
formers react differently to the increased heat and are better able to cool 
whereas dry-type transformers are more susceptible to the harmonic cur-
rent effects and are so labeled. The UL test addresses coil heating due to 
nonlinear loads and overheating of the neutral conductor.
There are two methods for calculating K-factor. They are UL method and 
normalized method. The UL method, based on the transformer’s rated rms 
current, is generally used when rms current is measured. The UL method is 
defi ned as follows:

where
h is the harmonic order
Ih(PU) is the rms current of the harmonic expressed as a per unit of the 
rated rms transformer current
The normalized method is based on the load’s fundamental current. Harmonic 
measurements are often taken with a harmonic analyzer. A majority of 
 harmonic analyzers output data is in per unit values related to the funda-
mental current. Therefore, the normalized method is applicable. The normal-
ized method is defi ned as follows:

where fh is the fundamental current in per unit (the fi rst harmonic = 100%)
An example of the two methods for the same harmonic spectrum of data is 
given in Tables 12.2 and 12.3.
The K-factor rating of dry-type transformers is available from 1 through 50. 
However, for majority of application rating of 20 or less should suffi ce. Table 12.4

The basic sources of data for computing K-factor are from  measurements 
or estimates. Exercise care in measuring loads so the data is  accurate and 
simulates the transformer at full load. When estimating loads, the com-
puted K-factor is usually overly conservative (large) as it does not take 
into account potential harmonic phase cancellations. To address this, UL 
has specifi ed that the rms current of any single harmonic greater than the 
10th be considered as no greater than 1/h of the fundamental rms current. 
This attempts to  compensate for otherwise conservative computed 
impacts of higher  frequencies. Equipment manufacturers can be a source 
of data for nonlinear loads. As K-factor increases, the transformer becomes 
larger and its impedance decreases markedly. Lower source impedance 
can result in higher distortion, which can aggravate a problem instead of 
solving it.
Another problem that occurs with transformers is the overheating of the 
neutral in a three-phase four-wire power distribution system. When single-
phase nonlinear loads are connected to the secondary of a wye–delta trans-
former, such as is found in many industrial and commercial applications, 
the triplen harmonics (third, ninth, and so on) algebraically add up in the 
neutral of the secondary of the transformer. These currents are often in 
excess of the phase currents and therefore cause overheating of the neutral 
conductor, components, bus bars, etc. Also these currents are refl ected back 
into the delta primary windings where they circulate and cause the trans-
former to overheat or fail.
12.5.2.2 Rotating Machines
The effects of harmonics in rotating machinery are increased heating due to 
copper and iron losses, changes in electromagnetic torque which affect, 
machine effi ciency and machine torsional oscillations. The level and impor-
tance of these effects depend on electric machine design and harmonic 
source type. Electric machines can be classifi ed as synchronous machines 
(three-phase), three-phase induction machines and single-phase induction 
motors. On the other hand, the source of harmonics for three-phase systems 
may be a balanced three-phase source or may be a single-phase source inject-
ing harmonics in one phase only. The latter case can be analyzed with the 
use of symmetrical components which is applicable to each one harmonic. 
Thus for three-phase electric machinery only the effects of balanced three-
phase harmonic excitation need to be examined. The effects of single-phase 
harmonic excitation can be deduced from the former. A good understand-
ing of the effects of harmonics on rotating machinery requires a good 
understanding of the electromagnetic fi elds inside the machines due to har-
monic currents. Because of the complex construction of rotating machinery, 
the frequency of the magnetic fl ux may not coincide with the frequency 
of the armature currents. In addition, at a given harmonic, the frequency of 
the magnetic fl ux in the rotor is different of the frequency in the stator. The 
below listed observations can be used for analyzing the effects of harmon-
ics on rotating machines.

752 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
 
1. The zero sequence harmonics (h = 3, 6, 9, 12, …) do not produce a net 
magnetic fl ux density. Thus the only effect they produce is ohmic 
losses.
 
2. The positive sequence harmonics (h = 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, …) produce a 
rotating magnetic fl ux which rotates with speed hw in the positive 
direction and magnitude proportional to the harmonic current. The 
relative speed of the rotating magnetic fi eld with respect to the rotor 
is (h − 1)w [or (h − 1 + S)w for induction machines, S = slip]. Because 
of induction motor action, an electromagnetic torque will be devel-
oped in the direction of rotation. The frequency of the alternating 
magnetic fl ux is 60 h in the stator and 60(h − 1) in the rotor. These 
frequencies determine the iron losses which occur partly in the 
stator and partly in the rotor.
 
3. The negative sequence harmonics (h = 2, 5, 8, 11, …) produce a rotat-
ing magnetic fl ux which rotates with speed −hw (opposite to the 
direction of rotation) and magnitude proportional to the harmonic 
current. The relative speed of the rotating magnetic fi eld with respect 
to the rotor is −(h + 1)w [(or −(h + 1 − S)w for an induction machine, 
S = slip)]. Because of induction motor action, an electromagnetic 
torque will be developed in a direction opposite to that of rotation. 
The frequency of the alternating magnetic fl ux is 60 h in the stator 
and 60(h + 1) in the rotor.
The performance of an induction motor, operating from a supply voltage 
rich in harmonics, deteriorates because the presence of negative sequence 
harmonics generates opposing torque and the presence of any harmonic 
increases copper and iron losses. These effects result in a net derating of 
the motor.
Another effect results from the interaction of the magnetic fi eld  generated 
by a harmonic and the fundamental magnetic fi eld. Consider, for example, 
the seventh harmonic in a synchronous, machine. The seventh harmonic 
magnetic fi eld rotates, relatively to the rotor fi eld, with a speed (h − 1)w. 
The interaction of the two fi elds will produce a pulsating torque of fre-
quency 60(h − 1) = 360 Hz. In the same way, the fi fth harmonic will gener-
ate a pulsating torque of frequency 60(h + 1) = 360 Hz. Thus pairs of 
harmonics generate pulsating torques of frequency 180, 360, 540 Hz, etc. 
In a typical system, the 360 Hz pulsating torque is substantial and results 
in oscillations of the machine shaft. It is possible that the natural fre-
quency of the machine is in the vicinity of this frequency. In this case, the 
fi fth and seventh harmonics may excite a super synchronous resonance 
condition which involves torsional oscillations of the rotor elements. 
Supersynchronous resonance occurs when the frequency of a mode of 
mechanical vibration exists close to the frequency of electrical stimulus. 
In this case, high resonant mechanical oscillations may be developed 
which could result in fatigue of the shafts.

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
753
The pulsating torques, due to the presence of harmonics, also result in 
higher noise emission as compared with pure sinusoidal excitation.
The ANSI standards C50.13-2005, American National Standard Requirements 
for Cylindrical-Rotor Synchronous Generators, defi nes a limit on the negative 
sequence current (60 Hz) for generators operating continuously at rated kVA 
and maximum current not exceeding 105% (of rated) in any phase.
12.5.2.3 Capacitor Banks
Capacitor impedance decreases with frequency. For this reason, capacitor 
banks act as sinks of harmonics. In a system with distributed harmonic 
sources, the harmonics will converge to the capacitor bank. As a result 
most harmonic problems show up fi rst at shunt capacitor banks. Severe 
harmonic problems at capacitor banks manifest themselves with (1) fuses 
blowing and (2) capacitor canister (can) failure. The presence of harmon-
ics at capacitor banks can cause:
Increased dielectric losses and thus heating
• 
Resonance conditions resulting in magnifi cation of harmonics
• 
Overvoltages
• 
Distribution line capacitor banks: Distribution capacitor banks can form a 
resonant circuit with the inductance of distribution lines at a frequency near 
the harmonics of interest. In this case, the harmonics may be amplifi ed at the 
capacitor location. Consider, for example, a portion of an overhead distribu-
tion circuit represented for simplicity with an R, L circuit, a capacitor bank, 
and a source of harmonics as in Figure 12.16.
The harmonic voltage, Vc, at the capacitor bank is given by the equation:

Today computer programs are available to predict these resonance conditions 
and the harmonic frequency can be predicted with which the capacitor will 
resonate. Therefore, this effect can be mitigated by installing a correct fi lter to 
shunt the harmonic currents thereby avoiding the resonance condition.
PF correction capacitor banks: Every power capacitor installation is in parallel 
with the inductance of the power system, and this combination is in reso-
nance at some frequency. If this frequency is at one of the static power con-
verters characteristic harmonics, the current of that harmonic can excite the 
resonant circuit and cause an oscillating current to be exchanged between 
the two energy storage elements. These high harmonic currents can produce 
high harmonic voltages which in turn can force harmonic currents to fl ow in 
adjacent circuits. This diversity of conditions makes it hard to determine if 
all parameters are going to be present to cause problems. This happens 
enough times to make system designers nervous when the combination of 
static power converters and power factor capacitors occurs on the same power 
system (see Figure 12.17).

Criteria for trouble: There are some quick rules of thumb that might be used 
to determine if there might be a problem. The fi rst is the resonant value of 
the combination of the system impedance and the capacitor bank size:
 
c
p
sc
SC MVA
CAP MVAR
X
f
X
=
=
 
where
fp is the per unit parallel resonant frequency
Xc is the capacitor bank reactance (per unit or ohms)
Xsc is the system reactance (per unit or ohms)
A second rule of thumb involves the size of the static power converter with 
respect to the size of the electrical system feeding the converter. The term 
short-circuit ratio (SCR) has been used to describe this and is defi ned as
 
short-circuitMVA
SCR =
converterMVA
 
If the converter is small compared to the system capacity, the per-unit 
harmonic currents will be small and the system impedance will be low, 
so any harmonic voltage will be insignifi cant. If the SCR is above 20 and the 
fp is above 8.5, the probability of problems is low. If the SCR is below 20, and 
if the parallel resonance fp is near one of the converter characteristic harmon-
ics, there is a high probability of producing excessive harmonic voltage and 
high harmonic currents. The increased use of static power converters and 
power factor capacitors can set up system conditions to cause problems. 
However, with the judicial design of fi lters using the power factor capacitors 
to control the harmonic currents from the static power converters, both pieces 
of equipment can be used to take full advantage of all the economics that 
both of them offer.
Another effect of the harmonic components on the capacitor bank is to 
cause additional heating because of increased dielectric losses. The increased 
losses due to harmonics may be calculated with

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
The overvoltage appearing at a capacitor bank due to the presence of 
harmonics depends on the phase relationship of harmonic and fundamental 
voltages. It is possible that the instantaneous overvoltage is greater than the rms 
overvoltage. As the corona inception and extinguishing voltage levels are a 
function of peak voltage, and not rms voltage, the life of the capacitor could be 
affected due to corona discharges. Capacitors, unlike most other power appara-
tus, have strict limits on current, kVAR, and voltage. The IEEE 18-2002, “Shunt 
power capacitors,” specifi es the limit on harmonics that the shunt capacitors can 
be subjected to under normal operation. The standard states that the capacitor 
may be continuously operated in the presence of harmonics provided (1) the 
total reactive power is not greater than 135% of its rated value, (2) the current 
due to the fundamental and harmonic frequency components does not exceed 
180% of rated rms value, and (3) the rms value of the applied voltage is not more 
than 110% of rated terminal voltage and the crest value (1.2 × (square root of 
two) ) of the applied voltage does not exceed 120% of rated peak voltage.
12.5.2.4 Switchgear
Harmonic components in the current waveform can affect the interruption 
capability of the switchgear. This takes place with two distinct mechanisms: 
(1) the presence of harmonics affects the rate of rise of the transient recovery 
voltage and the maximum value of the transient voltage and (2) harmonics 
affect the operation of the blowout coil in the stored-energy breakers. These 
effects will be discussed next.
The presence of current harmonics may result in high di/dt values at 
 current zero. In this case, the rate of rise of the transient recovery voltage 
across the breaker will be higher than normal creating the possibility of 
dielectric failure and restrike. Also, the presence of harmonic currents affects 
the time that current crosses zero. This time affects the crest value of the 
transient recovery voltage. For example, if this time coincides with the maxi-
mum of the source voltage (fundamental), the crest value of the transient 
recovery voltage can reach 2.82 E where E is the rms value of the rated volt-
age. This value may cause breaker restrike. Circuit breakers have failed to 
interrupt currents due to the inability of the blowout coils to operate ade-
quately in the presence of severe harmonics. As the blowout coil assists in 
the arc’s movement into the arc chute where the interruption takes place, its 
ineffi cient operation prolongs arcing and eventually results in breaker fail-
ure. Similar problems can exist in other current interrupting devices such as 
load break switches, circuit switchers, etc. Vacuum breakers are less sensi-
tive to harmonic currents. There are no defi nite standards set forth by the 
industry on the level of harmonic currents that switching devices are required 
to interrupt. All the interrupting tests are performed at the rated supply fre-
quency. The effect of harmonics on transient recovery voltage is by far the 
most diffi cult because it depends on specifi c system confi guration.
One of the principal problems due to harmonics is the one that occurs within 
the switchgear neutral of three-phase four-wire systems when harmonics are 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
757
present. The problem associated with neutrals is the result of the addition of 
triplen harmonic currents (i.e., multiple of the third harmonic) to the funda-
mental current in the neutral. The result often is that the neutral, which would 
normally carry very little current in a balanced three-phase system, now 
carries currents in excess of the phase currents for the system. Since neutral 
conductors, lugs, bus bars, etc, often are sized smaller than phase conductors 
and current components, the result is that the neutral system components are 
overloaded and often overheat, fail, or even burn down.
12.5.2.5 Protective Relays
Relays that depend on voltage/current crest or voltage zeroes for their opera-
tion are obviously affected by HD. System harmonics affect relay operation 
in a very complex manner. The induction disk and electromechanical relays 
are affected in the following way. The presence of harmonic currents results 
in additional torque components altering the time delay characteristics of the 
relays. Ground relays cannot distinguish between zero sequence current and 
third harmonic current. Thus, the presence of excessive third harmonic cur-
rent can cause ground relays to trip. A recent Canadian study documents the 
effects of harmonics on relay operation as follows:
 
1. Relays exhibited a tendency to operate slower and/or with higher 
pickup values rather than to operate faster and/or with lower pickup 
values.
 
2. Static underfrequency relays were susceptible to substantial changes 
in operating characteristics.
 
3. In most cases, the changes in operating characteristics were  relatively 
small over the moderate range of distortion expected during normal 
operation.
 
4. Depending on the manufacturer, the overvoltage and overcurrent 
relays exhibited various changes in operating characteristics.
 
5. Depending on harmonic content, operating torques of relays can be 
reversed.
 
6. Operating times can vary widely as a function of frequency mix in 
the metered quantity.
 
7. Balanced beam impedance relays can exhibit both overreach and 
underreach.
 
8. Harmonics can impair the high speed operation of differential 
relays. Several tests indicated that the relays could exhibit complete 
restraint.
In general, the harmonic levels required to cause misoperation of relays are 
greater than levels which would be considered maximum acceptable limits 
for other equipment. Harmonic levels of 10%–20% are generally required to 
cause problems with relay operation, except in unusual circumstances.

758 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
12.5.2.6 Metering Devices
Metering and instrumentation are affected by the presence of voltage and 
current harmonics. Induction disk devices, such as watt-hour meters and 
overcurrent relays, are designed and calibrated only for the fundamental 
current and voltage. The presence of harmonic currents and voltages gener-
ates additional electromagnetic torque on the disk which can cause errone-
ous operation. A Canadian study indicates that a 20% fi fth harmonic content 
can produce 10%–15% error in a two element three-phase watt transducer. 
Other studies have shown that the error due to harmonics may be positive, 
negative, or smaller with third harmonics. This, of course, is dependent on 
the type of meter under consideration. Solid-state meters can measure power 
based on waveshape. In general, the distortion must be severe (>20%) before 
signifi cant errors are detected.
12.5.2.7 Electronic Equipment
In many cases, electronic equipment are signifi cant sources of harmonics. 
On the other hand, the operation of electronic equipment is often depen-
dent on accurate determination of voltage zero crossings or other aspects 
of the voltage waveshape. For example, HD can result in a shifting of the 
zero crossing of the voltage waveform. This may be critical for many types 
of electronic circuit controls, and misoperation, such as commutation fail-
ures, can result from the shifts of the zero crossing. A large class of loads 
utilize energy in some form other than at the incoming line frequency, and 
require rectifi cation or frequency conversion. External distortion may 
affect the performance of either the power converter or the converter load. 
The severity of these effects are infl uenced by the equipment design. 
Analysis of these effects is complicated by the fact that the converter itself 
is a complex nonlinear apparatus producing its own harmonics. Inverters 
used for DC to AC conversion or vice versa, generate a voltage notch 
during commutation. Voltage notching effects are of suffi cient concern 
that notch limits on distorting apparatus have been included in some 
standards and guidelines. Voltage and current distortion may lead to dis-
ruption of the operation of electronic equipment. These disruptions may 
be divided into two categories: disruption of the converter operation and 
disruption of the converter load operation. The diversity of converter 
designs and the wide range of loads fed by these converters makes any 
general analysis diffi cult. It can be noted, however, that these disruptions 
are very much a function of converter design, and that electrical  isolation 
of the sensitive load from loads producing distortion reduces the likeli-
hood of disruption. Empirical data and operating experience with steady 
state voltage and current distortion in industrial plants has led to specifi c 
design recommendations summarized in the IEEE standard 519-1992, 
“IEEE guide for harmonic control and reactive compensation of static 
power converters.”

where

V1 is the PU fundamental voltage
V is the PU rms voltage (to rated voltage base)
n is a constant (representative value for n is 13)
It can be noted that large distortion factors will signifi cantly shorten the bulb 
life, and that changes in the fundamental voltage are relatively more signifi -
cant than changes in the distortion factor.
Arc lamps: The various types of arc lamps exhibit nonlinear resistance 
characteristics where the resistance declines as the current increases. The 
lamps have a safe operating region, and a ballast is required to place the 
lamp operating point in the safe region for all line voltage conditions 
throughout the range of various lamp characteristics. During normal lamp 
operation, the ballast functions as a current-limiting element. With 
 inductive ballasts, the infl uence of voltage distortion would be roughly 
described by the distortion factor. It would appear that modest distortion 
factors would not cause a large shift in the lamp-operating point. Capacitive 
ballasts must be viewed with some concern, however, as the ballast reac-
tance would drop as the frequency of the harmonic rises. Because the bulb 
itself is a highly nonlinear device, it is not at all clear what effect voltage 
distortion would have on lamps with capacitive ballasts.
12.6 Predictive Maintenance and PQ Measurements*
12.6.1 Introduction
In this section a discussion is provided on PQ measurements that can be 
used as predictive maintenance of power system and plant equipment. 
Unexpected failures can be avoided in both production equipment and power 
system apparatus when basic PQ measurements are added to maintenance 
* This predictive PQ guide is based on information provided by Fluke Corporation.

procedures. Insurance claims data in the NFPA 70B indicates that roughly 
half of the cost associated with electrical failures could be prevented by 
regular maintenance. A study published in IEEE 493-1997 says that a poorly 
maintained system can attribute 49% of its failures to lack of maintenance. 
To determine the cost of a failure, it helps to consider the cost of lost income 
(gross margin) due to downtime, cost of labor to troubleshoot, patch, clean 
up, repair and restart, and cost of damaged equipment and materials, 
including repairs, replacements and scrapped materials.
Predictive maintenance of PQ focuses on a small set of measurements that 
can predict power distribution or critical load failures. By checking the PQ at 
critical loads, one can see the effect of the electrical system up to the load. The 
predictive maintenance inspection program should include motors, genera-
tors, pumps, A/C units, fans, gearboxes, or chillers on site. The voltage stability, 
HD, and unbalance voltages are good indicators of load and distribution system 
health and can be taken and recorded quickly with little incremental labor. 
Current measurements can identify changes in the way the load parameters 
are changing. All of these measurements can be taken without halting opera-
tions and measurement data can easily be entered into computer maintenance 
management software (CMMS) and plotted over time (see Section 1.4.3.5 for 
information on CMMS). For each measurement point or piece of equipment, 
limits can be set to trigger corrective action. Limits should be set well below the 
point of failure, and as time goes on limits may be tightened or loosened by 
analyzing historical data. The appropriate limits depend somewhat on the 
ability of the loads to deal with power variation. But for most equipment, the 
maintenance team can devise a set of default, house limits based on industry 
standards and experience. The cost of three-phase power analyzers and other 
PQ tools is lower now than before and measurements discussed in this section 
should be part of the predictive maintenance program.
12.6.2 Safety Standards for Test Instruments
12.6.2.1 Test Instrument Standards
IEC 61010 establishes international safety requirements for low voltage (1000 V 
or less) electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use. 
The low voltage power distribution system is divided into four categories, 
based on the proximity to the power source. Within each category are voltage 
listings—1000, 600, 300 V, etc. The key concept to understand is that you 
should use a meter rated to the highest category, as well as the highest volt-
age, that you might be working in. For PQ troubleshooting, a meter rated to 
CAT IV-600 V should always be used. The CAT ratings should be marked 
near the voltage inputs of the instrument. IEC 61010 requires increased pro-
tection against the hazards of transient overvoltages. Transients can cause an 
arc-over inside an inadequately protected meter. When that arc-over occurs 
in a high energy environment, such as a three-phase feeder circuit, the result 
can be a dangerous arc blast. The potential exists for serious harm to person-
nel as well as damage to the meter. Also, when undertaking PQ  measurements, 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance

the personnel should follow the requirements of safety-related work prac-
tices listed in Chapter 13 of the NFPA 70E, and rules promulgated by OSHA 
(Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Subtitle B, Chapter XVII, subpart S, 
paragraph 1910.331–1910.335) for safety-related work practices. Further, the 
instrument’s manufacturer application notes and information should be con-
sulted when making such measurements. The four categories of electrical 
equipment for measurements are depicted in Figure 12.18.
Manufacturers can self-certify that they meet IEC 61010 specifi cations, but 
there are obvious pitfalls for the end-user in self-certifi cation. Certifi cation 
by an independent testing laboratory provides assurance that the meter 
meets IEC requirements. Before using the test instruments, look for a symbol 
and listing number of an independent testing laboratory such as UL, CSA, 
TÜV, VDE, or others.

12.6.2.2 Instruments for PQ Measurements
PQ monitoring requires a variety of instruments due to the many different mea-
surements that must be performed. A general description of test instruments is 
given in this to make the reader familiar with the instruments that are normally 
used for PQ surveys and/or measurements. As an example, Table 12.5 lists the 
test instruments manufactured by Fluke Corporation which are applicable to 
the type of measurements discussed in this section. Similar instruments are 
available from other manufactures. Note that a true-rms multimeter, ammeter,

ground impedance tester, and power line monitor/analyzer are absolutely 
essential equipment for minimum effective power disturbance detection 
and analysis.
True-rms multimeters: A true-rms digital multimeter is used to measure 
voltage and continuity.
True-rms clamp-on ammeters: A true-rms clamp-on ammeter is used to mea-
sure current and analyze current waveforms, particularly when sinusoidal 
waveforms are involved. It is recommended due to the ease of use and broad 
bandwidth characteristics of transformer-based meter designs. Several types 
of ammeters currently are available such as direct reading and indirect read-
ing ammeters.
Ground impedance testers: A ground impedance tester is a multifunctional instru-
ment designed to detect wiring and ground problems in low-voltage power dis-
tribution systems. Such problems can include: wiring errors,  neutral–ground 
(N–G) shorts and reversals, IG shorts ground, and neutral impedance shorts. 
Some testers are designed for use on 120 V AC single-phase systems while others 
can be used on both single and three-phase  systems up to 600 V AC.
Earth ground tester: An earth ground tester is used to measure the ground 
electrode impedance. Ground resistance tests should be conducted with a 
fall-of-potential method instrument. Clamp-on instruments that do not 
require the grounding electrode to be isolated from the building may be 
used with the understanding that these instrument may not give the most 
accurate readings of the ground electrode impedance.
Oscilloscope: An oscilloscope can be used to detect harmonics in an electri-
cal system. It also can be used for noise measurements when combined with 
a line decoupler. In this case, the input is connected to the voltage of interest 
with the appropriate lead. If a voltage above the range of the oscilloscope is 
to be examined, probes with resistance-divider networks are available to 
extend the range of the instrument.
Spectrum analyzers: A spectrum analyzer equipped with appropriate 
 measurement capabilities can be used to measure harmonics, electrical noise, 
and frequency deviations. Special-purpose harmonic meters or low fre-
quency or broadband spectrum analyzers also can be used to measure these 
voltage and current disturbances.
Static meters: Static meters typically are used to measure ESD. These are 
handheld devices.
Psychrometer: A psychrometer is used to measure temperature and humid-
ity in the environment, although such measurements also can be made with 
power monitoring devices equipped with special probes.
Field strength meter: A fi eld strength meter equipped with a special probe 
can be used to measure electric or magnetic fi eld strength.

Infrared detectors: Infrared detectors can be used to detect overheating of 
transformers, circuit breakers, and other electrical apparatus.
12.6.3 PQ Measurement Guidelines
PQ covers a wide range of issues, from voltage disturbances like voltage dips 
(sags), swells, outages and transients, to current harmonics, to performance 
wiring and grounding. The symptoms of poor PQ include intermittent lock-
ups and resets, corrupted data, premature equipment failure, overheating of 
components for no apparent cause, etc. The ultimate cost is in downtime, 
decreased productivity, and frustrated personnel. This application note gives 
information on how to troubleshoot PQ problems. It also gives you informa-
tion on how to start fi xing those problems. But before grabbing that meter, 
the following cautionary notes must be adhered to:
 
1. Suggested measurements should only be made by qualifi ed personnel 
who are trained to make these measurements in a safe manner, 
using proper procedures and test tools rated for work on electrical 
power circuits.
 
2. To the best of the author’s knowledge, recommended solutions are 
consistent with the NEC, but in any case, NFPA 70 (NEC), NFPA 70E, 
and OSHA requirements must not be violated.
 
3. The information provided in this guidance is believed to be accurate 
and current, but it is not intended to be a substitute for the special-
ized knowledge and experience of professional PQ practitioners. 
What this application guide offers is a starter kit, not the fi nal word 
on PQ predictive maintenance.
12.6.3.1 Preparation for Conducting Measurements
To troubleshoot PQ problems, one approach is to start as close to the problem 
load as possible. The problem load is the sensitive load, typically electronic, 
that is somehow malfunctioning. Poor PQ is suspected, but part of your job 
is to isolate PQ as a cause from other possible causes (hardware,  software?). 
Like any detective, you should start at the scene of the crime. This bottom-up 
approach can take you a long way. It relies on making use of a sharp eye 
and on taking some basic measurements. An alternative is to start at the 
service entrance, using a three-phase monitor, and work back to the  problem 
load. This is most useful if the problems originate with the utility. Yet survey 
after survey has concluded that the great majority of PQ problems originate 
in the facility. In fact, as a general rule, PQ is best at the service entrance 
(connection to utility) and deteriorates as you move downstream through 
the distribution system. That is because the facility’s own loads are causing 
the problems. Another illuminating fact is that 75% of PQ problems are 
related to wiring and grounding problems! For this reason, many PQ 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
765
authorities recommend that a logical trouble shooting fl ow is to fi rst diag-
nose the electrical infrastructure of the facility, then monitor if necessary. 
The bottom-up troubleshooting procedure is designed to help you do this 
detective work.
 
1. Make a map: Obtain or create a current one-line diagram of the power 
distribution system. It is tough to diagnose PQ problems without 
having a working knowledge of the site being investigated. You can 
start by locating or reconstructing a “as built” one-line (or three-line) 
diagram of the distribution system (see Figure 12.19). The one-line 
will identify the AC power sources and the loads they serve. If you 
work on-site, the map might already exist in your head, but it will be 
a big help to everyone, including yourself, if it is on paper. If you 
are coming to a work site for the fi rst time, getting an up-to-date one-
line means identifying new loads or other recent changes in the 
system. Why go to this effort? Systems are dynamic; they change over 
time, often in unplanned and haphazard ways. Furthermore, while 
some problems are local in origin and effect, there are many problems 
that result from interactions between one part of the system and 
another. Your job is to understand these system interactions. The more 
complete your documentation, the better off you will be. It is true, 
however, that the sites that need the most help are the ones least likely 
to have a good record of what is going on in their system. So the simple 
rule is, at this point in the investigation, do the best you can to get 
good documentation, but do not count on it being available.

2. Do a walk around of the site. Sometimes a visual inspection will 
offer immediate clues:
A transformer that is much too hot
• 
Wiring or connections discolored from heat
• 
Receptacles with extension strips daisy-chained to extension strips
• 
Signal wiring running in the same trays as power cables
• 
Extra N–G bonds in subpanels
• 
Grounding conductors connected to pipes that end in midair. At a 
• 
minimum, you will get a sense of how the facility is wired and 
what the typical loads are
 
3. Interview affected personnel and keep an incident log. Interview the 
people operating the affected equipment. You will get a description 
of the problem and often turn up unexpected clues. It is also good 
practice to keep a record of when problems happen and what the 
symptoms are. This is most important for problems that are inter-
mittent. The goal is to fi nd some pattern that helps correlate the 
occurrence of the problem in the problem load to a simultaneous 
event elsewhere. Logically, this trouble-logging is the responsibility 
of the operator closest to the affected equipment.
 
4. The typical electrical distribution system for a commercial building 
or a light industrial facility is shown in Figure 12.19 that can be 
divided in to two parts: (1) distribution system and (2) three-phase 
loads. We will start the predictive maintenance from the bottom-up, 
i.e., starting at the branch circuit and moving up to the service panel, 
transformer, and then going into three-phase loads as listed below.

12.6.3.2 Basic Power Measurements
The basic power measurements for assessing PQ problems are phase voltages, 
neutral-to-ground voltage, phase currents, voltage and current distortion, 
voltage unbalance or imbalance, etc. The basic power measurements for PQ 
are listed in Table 12.6

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
767
Good voltage level and stability are fundamental requirements for reliable 
equipment operation. The following power conditions are indicative of PQ 
problems and should be checked.
Voltage: Running loads at overly high or low voltages causes reliability 
problems and failures. Verify that line voltage is within 10% of the name-
plate’s rating. As connections in the power system deteriorate, the rising 
impedance will cause drops in voltage. Added loads, especially those with 
high inrush, will also cause voltage decline over time. The loads farthest 
from the service entrance or transformer will show the lowest voltage. 
Neutral-to-ground voltage shows how heavily the power system is loaded 
and helps quantify the triplen harmonic currents. Neutral-to-ground voltage 
higher than 3% should trigger further investigation.
Voltage sag count: Taking a single voltage reading tells only part of the story. 
How is the voltage changing during an hour and during a day? Sags, swells, 
and transients are short-term variations in voltage. The voltage sag (or dip) is 
the most common and troublesome variety. Sags indicate that a system is having 
trouble responding to load requirements and signifi cant sags can interrupt pro-
duction. Voltage sags can cause spurious resets on electronic equipment such as 
computers or controllers, and sag on one phase can cause the other two to over-
compensate, potentially tripping the circuit. Sags have several dimensions: 
depth, duration, and time of day. Utilities use a special index to track the number 
of sags that occur over a period of time. To gauge the depth of the sags, they 
count how often voltage drops below various thresholds. The longer and larger 
the voltage variations more likely the equipment is susceptible to malfunction. 
For example, the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) curve speci-
fi es 120 V computer equipment should be able to run as long as voltage does not 
drop below 96 V for more than 10 s or below 84 V for more than 0.5 s.
Current: Current measurements that trend upward are a key indicator of a 
problem or degradation in the load. While equipment is running, monitor 
phase, neutral and ground current over time. Make sure none of the currents 
are increasing signifi cantly, verify that they are less than the nameplate rating, 
and keep an eye out for high neutral current, which can indicate harmonics 
and unbalance.

Voltage unbalance: In a three-phase system, signifi cant differences in phase 
voltage indicate a problem with the system or a defect in a load. High voltage 
unbalance causes three-phase loads to draw excessive current and causes 
motors to deliver lower torque. Also, it causes motor overheating, for exam-
ple, 3% unbalance in voltage causes a temperature rise of 25°C. The negative 
sequence voltage (Vneg) and zero sequence voltage (Vzero) are an indication of  
voltage asymmetry between phases. It is desirable to keep Vneg to be less than 
2%. The negative sequence voltage and zero sequence voltage are also 
referred to as V2 and V0, respectively.
Voltage HD: HD is a normal consequence of a power system supplying elec-
tronic loads such as computers, business machines, electronic lighting bal-
lasts, and control systems. Adding or removing loads from the system 
changes the amount of distortion, so it is a good idea to regularly check har-
monics. Harmonics cause heating and reduced life in motor windings and 
transformers, excessive neutral current, increased susceptibility to voltage 
sags, and reduced transformer effi ciency. As current harmonics interact with 
impedance, they are converted into voltage harmonics. THD is a sum of the 
contributions of all harmonics. By tracking voltage THD over time one can 
determine if distortion is changing. The voltage harmonic distortion (voltage 
THD) in accordance with IEEE 519 should be less than 5%.
12.6.3.3 Measurements at the Receptacle of a Branch Circuit
Many PQ problems show up at the branch circuit level. There is a simple 
reason for this: that is where most of the sensitive loads are located. It is also 
the end of the line of the electrical distribution system, and the place where 
shortcomings cannot be hidden. Let us assume you have been called in to 
solve the problem. You have already talked to the people involved have a 
rough idea of the symptoms (equipment lockups, intermittent resets or 
crashes, etc.) and as much sense of the timing and history of the problems as 
you can get. So it is time to gather hard evidence: it is time to take measure-
ments. Our primary focus with troubleshooting at the receptacle level is to 
determine if the L–N voltage available is of suffi cient stability and amplitude 
to supply the needs of the load(s). Make the following measurements.
Waveform: The waveform gives us quick snapshot information. An ideal 
waveform would be a sine wave. In this case, (Figure 12.20) the voltage wave-
form is fl at-topped, which is typical of a building with many nonlinear loads 
such as computers and other offi ce equipment. Our other measurements will 
tell us whether this fl at-topping is excessive.
Peak voltage: The peak value is critical to electronic loads because the elec-
tronic power supply charges its internal capacitors to the peak value of the 
line voltage. If the peak is too low, it affects the ability of the caps to charge 
fully and the ability of the power supply to ride through momentary dips in 
the line voltage. For an rms voltage of 120 V, the peak value for a sine wave 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
769
should be 169.7 V (1.414 × 120 V). However, as we see from Figure 12.20, the 
fl at-topped waveform will have a lower peak value.
The fl at-topped waveform is typical of the voltage in facilities with com-
puter loads. What causes fl at-topping? The utility supplies AC power, but 
electronic equipment runs on DC power. The conversion of AC into DC is 
done by the power supply (SMPS) of the computer. The SMPS has a diode 
bridge which turns AC into pulsating DC, which then charges a capacitor. 
As the load draws the capacitor down, the capacitor recharges. However, 
the capacitor only takes power from the peak of the wave to replenish itself, 
since that is the only time the supplied voltage is higher than its own voltage. 
The capacitor ends up drawing current in pulses at each half-cycle peak of the 
supplied AC voltage. This is happening with virtually all the electronic loads 
on the circuit. If the AC power source were perfectly stiff, meaning that it had 
an infi nite capacity to supply all the current that was required, then there 
would be no such thing as fl at-topping (or sags or any voltage distortion). 
There are practical limits to what the AC power source can supply. This limit 
is usually described by a concept called source  impedance, which is the total 
impedance from the point where the load is located back to the source. There 
are two major contributors to this source impedance. One is the wiring; the 
longer the conductor and the smaller the diameter (higher gauge), the higher 
the impedance. The other factor is the internal impedance of the power supply 
transformer (or other source  equipment). This internal impedance is simply a 
way of saying that a transformer of a given size/rating can only supply so 
much current. The source impedance is naturally greatest at the end of a 
branch circuit, the farthest point from the source. That is the same place where 
all those electronic loads are demanding current at the peak of the wave. The

result is that the voltage peak tends to get dragged down—in other words, 
fl at-topped. The more loads there are, the greater the fl at-topping. Also, the 
higher the source impedance, the greater the fl at-topping of the voltage wave-
form is going to be incurred.
Rms voltage: Nominal line voltage is measured in rms which corresponds to 
the effective heating value. Equipment is rated in rms, not peak, because their 
main limitation has to do with heat dissipation. rms voltage can be too high 
or too low, but it is usually the low voltage that causes problems. Low rms 
voltage combined with fl at-topping (low peak) is a deadly combination for 
sensitive loads. Voltage drop is a function of both the loading of the circuit 
and the source impedance, which in effect means the length and diameter 
(gauge) of the wire run. The NEC (210-19.a, FPN No. 4) recommends a limit of 
a 3% voltage drop from the branch circuit breaker to the farthest outlet, and 
a total voltage drop of less than 5% including the feeder and branch circuit.
Recording (short-term): The limitation of the above measurement is that it is 
static. Many loads require more current (inrush current) when they are fi rst 
turned on. This momentary high current may cause a momentary low voltage 
(sag) because of the additional IR drop through the conductors. Such sags are 
often caused by loads drawing inrush currents on the same branch circuit, or 
on the same panelboard. You can measure a worst case sag of 100 ms or more 
(about six cycles at 60 Hz) by using a rms digital multimeter, while energizing 
the load. What if you want to know if there are recurring sags? The recurring 
sags can be recorded by using a PQ analyzer which will continuously capture 
sags of as little as single cycle duration (17 ms). A 1 h recording time may be 
enough to indicate if there are recurring sags and swells.
Recording (long-term): For longer term recording an instrument, such as 
Fluke’s VR1710 voltage event recorder, can be used to record sags, swells, 
outages, transients, and frequency deviations while plugged into the outlet. 
The device can be left on-site, unattended, for days and weeks, all the time 
catching intermittent events. The correlation of equipment malfunction with 
voltage events is hard evidence of a PQ problem.
N–G voltage: Let us say a simple L–N measurement at the outlet has a low 
reading. The low reading does not tell if the reading is low because the feeder 
voltage is low (at the subpanel), or if the branch circuit is overloaded. You 
could try to measure the voltage at the panel, but it is not always easy to tell 
which panel feeds the outlet you are measuring and it is also sometimes incon-
venient to access a panel. N–G voltage is often an easier way of assuring the 
loading on a circuit. As the current travels through the circuit, there is a certain 
amount of voltage drop in the hot conductor and in the neutral conductor. The 
drop on the hot and neutral conductors will be the same if they are the same 
gauge and length. The total voltage drop on both conductors is subtracted 
from the source voltage and is that much less voltage available to the load. 
The bigger the load, the higher the current, and the greater the N–G voltage 
drop. Think of N–G voltage as the mirror of L–N voltage: if L–N voltage is 
low, that will show up as a higher N–G voltage. N–G voltage exists because of 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
771
the voltage drop due to the current traveling through the neutral back to the 
N–G bond. If the system is correctly wired, there should be no N–G bond 
except at the source transformer (at what the NEC calls the source of the sepa-
rately derived system (SDS), which is usually a transformer). Under this situ-
ation, the ground conductor should have virtually no current and therefore no 
voltage drop on it. In effect, the ground wire is available as a long test lead 
back to the N–G bond.
Shared neutrals: The three-phase circuits are usually wired so that they share 
a single neutral. The original idea was to duplicate on the branch circuit level 
the four wire (three phases and a neutral) wiring of panelboards. Theoretically, 
only unbalanced current should return on the neutral. If the loads supplied 
from the three-phase circuits are balanced, which is usually the case for linear 
loads then there should be minimum current returning on the neutral. 
However, this is not the case with nonlinear (electronic) loads, therefore the 
single neutral carries a much higher current. This old conventional method 
of wiring has become a problem with the growth of single-phase nonlinear 
loads. The problem is that zero sequence current from nonlinear loads, pri-
marily third harmonic, will add up arithmetically and return on the neutral. 
In addition to being a potential safety problem because of overheating of an 
undersized neutral, the extra neutral current creates a higher N–G voltage. 
Remember that this N–G voltage subtracts from the L–N voltage available to 
the load. The measurement of N–G voltage of a shared neutral is shown in 
Figure 12.21.
The following guide is offered on the N–G measurements for assessing and 
resolving PQ problems.
 
1. A rule-of-thumb used by the industry is that N–G voltage of 2 V or 
less at the receptacle is okay, while a few volts or more indicates 
overloading; 5 V is seen as the upper limit. There is obviously some 
room for judgment in this measurement.
 
2. A high reading could indicate a shared branch neutral, i.e., a neutral 
shared between more than one branch circuit. This shared neutral 
simply increases the opportunities for overloading as well as for one 
circuit to affect another.
 
3. A certain amount of N–G voltage is normal in a loaded circuit. 
If the reading is stable at close to 0 V, suspect an illegal N–G bond in 
the receptacle (often due to loose strands of the neutral touching some 
ground point) or at the subpanel. Any N–G bonds other than those at 
the transformer source (and/or main panel) should be removed to 
prevent return currents fl owing through the ground conductors.
 
4. If N–G voltage is low at the receptacle, you are in good shape. If it is 
high, then you still have to determine if the problem is mainly at the 
branch circuit level, or mainly at the panel level. Remember, assum-
ing there is no illegal N–G bond in intervening panels or receptacles, 
your ground test lead goes all the way back to the source, so you are 
reading voltage drops all the way to the source.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Summary: The PQ measurements on receptacle of branch circuits as 
 discussed above are summarized in the Table 12.7. The quality of power 
depends on quality wiring which is referred to in the industry as perfor-
mance wiring. The basic intent of performance wiring is to maintain or 
restore correct L–N voltage to the load. There is a distinction between per-
formance wiring and code minimum wiring. The NEC sets the absolute 
minimum requirements for a wiring and is primarily concerned with fi re 
prevention and personnel safety. The NEC should, of course, never be vio-
lated, but it is also important to understand that the Code’s objective is not 
to establish standards to achieve PQ. However, many facilities are fi nding 
that it pays to take the extra step and install or even retrofi t facilities with 
performance wiring for correct operation of nonlinear loads. The attri-
butes of performance wiring are listed in Table 12.8. There are also situa-
tions where receptacle-installed power conditioning devices are a good 
solution, either as a complement to the wiring changes or as an economi-
cally viable alternative to some wiring changes. By monitoring voltage 
events at the receptacle, any anomalies in the voltage (phase-neutral and 
N–G) can be detected. Predictive maintenance of PQ will ensure that that 
the sensitive loads are receiving the correct voltage.

12.6.3.4 Measurement at the Service Panel
In the bottom-up approach, the next step is to inspect and monitor PQ 
attributes at the service panel. While inspecting, checkout for the following:
Visual inspection
• 
Feeder conductor current test
• 
Neutral conductor current test (feeder and branch)
• 
Phase-to-neutral voltage test (feeder and branch)
• 
N–G voltage test (feeder)
• 
Circuit breaker voltage drop and current on branch phase conductors
• 
The service panel is where the effects of single-phase harmonic loads are easy 
to measure. A true-rms meter ensures accurate readings of nonlinear volt-
ages and currents. Refer to Table 12.9 for comparison of average reading and 
true-rms reading multimeters.
Visual inspection
Look for an illegal N–G bond in subpanels (see Figure 12.22). This is 
• 
a violation of the NEC as well as of PQ wiring. It is also extremely 
common. If an illegal N–G bond is found in one panel at a site, it is 
likely to be in any number of them. Who knows why they are there: 
perhaps the installer was thinking that all panels are wired like resi-
dential service panels; or that the quickest way to reduce N–G volt-
age was to install a jumper, or that the more grounds the better. In 
any case, remove all illegal N–G bonds—no exceptions.
Look for signs of overheating, such as discolored connecting lugs.

Loose connections and excessive loading show up as heat. High

levels of harmonic current that were not accounted for in the original 
wire sizing can also cause overheating. Infrared sensors are the 
preferred method for noncontact temperature measurement.
Of particular concern is the size of the feeder neutral conductor. 
• 
It has long been understood that any fundamental current resulting 
from the unbalance of single-phase loads among the three phases 
will return on the neutral, but a relatively recent phenomenon is the 
third harmonic (triplen) currents generated by nonlinear single-
phase loads that all return on the neutral. The NEC-1996, the fi rst 
time stated that “On a four-wire, three-phase wye circuit where the 
major portion of the load consists of nonlinear loads, there are har-
monic currents present in the neutral conductor, and the neutral 
shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor.” (Article 310, 
“Notes to ampacity tables of 0 to 2000 Volts,” Note 10.c). In effect, 
this requires that the neutral conductor should be at least equal to 
the size of the phase conductor. Many experts now recommend that 
the neutral be double the size of the phase conductor.
Check for shared branch neutrals. Count neutral conductors for 
• 
branch circuits: if there are fewer than the phase conductors, there 
are shared neutrals.
Check tightness of conduit connections, especially if the conduit is being 
• 
used exclusively as the grounding conductor (not recommended).
Measurements
The measurements that are to be made at the service panel are summarized 
in Table 12.10.

Feeder phase current: Check each phase to make sure it is not overloaded. 
Also check for excessive unbalance.
Feeder neutral current: Measure the feeder neutral conductor for cumulative 
neutral current. Third harmonic currents from all three phases will add arith-
metically in the neutral.
Feeder N–G voltage test: Measure the neutral-to-ground voltage, excessive 
N–G voltage indicates overloading. A N–G voltage at or very near zero indi-
cates the existence of an illegal N–G bond in a subpanel.
Phase-to-neutral voltage test: Phase-to-neutral voltages are measured and 
recorded. They can be compared with receptacle L–N voltages to measure 
voltage drop.
Branch neutral current: Measure each branch neutral for overloading. The 
 neutrals are measured instead of the phase conductors because they might 
share the return current of several phase conductors, yet they are not pro-
tected by breakers.
Circuit breaker voltage drop: The voltage drop across a set of breaker contacts 
will give you a quick measure of the wear of those contacts. Ideally, the 
 voltage drop should be zero. In practice, there will be some voltage drop in 
the millivolt range, with the exact value being dependent on the load current. 
As a general rule, the voltage drop should not exceed 20–100 mV, depending 
on load. This test can also be performed as contact resistance measurement 
test. For more details refer to Chapter 8.

In addition, the following should be considered to reduce the effects of 
harmonics if PQ problems are encountered at the service panel:
 
1. Double the neutral, going beyond the NEC requirements.
 
2. Use nonlinear load panels.
 
3. Install zero sequence fi lters. Such a fi lter effectively sinks the third 
harmonic, preventing overloading on the feeder neutral and the 
transformer.
 
4. Install zigzag transformers.
 
5. Replace older motor drives with newer, harmonics compensated ones.
 
6. Coping with harmonics involves larger neutrals and other methods of 
better being able to handle the harmonics that are present. Curing har-
monics involves eliminating or reducing harmonics at their source.
 
7. In some cases, you can try to reduce the spread of harmonics in the 
system—for example, by putting certain loads on their own trans-
former and panel.
 
8. Many harmonics problems exist because of the way things are wired. 
Major rewiring is usually expensive in terms of downtime and so it 
is not normally the fi rst method used to fi ght a harmonics problem.
 
9. Look carefully at the system before implementing any curing or 
coping method, so you do not wind up trying one after another until

you fi nally have to concede you should have rewired to begin with. 
The trial and error approach to fi xing harmonics-related problems 
will usually delay an effective remedy, while dramatically raising 
the total cost of solving the problem.
 10. With the right testing on the particular wiring, you can isolate the 
problem and proceed with reasonable certainty as to whether a 
wiring change is required or not.
 11. To correct phase unbalance:
Redistribute loads to different phases to balance current in three 
• 
phases. Look for single-phase loads being fed from primarily one 
phase in the panel.
This redistribution and balancing has many benefi ts. It reduces 
• 
the risk of overheating any particular phase in the transformer, 
minimizes neutral current, reduces the chances of nuisance 
breaker tripping, and provides other advantages in terms of main-
tenance and reliability.
 12. To correct loose connections, use an infrared sensor to check for hot 
spots. Do not use the method of retorquing to prevent loose connec-
tions. This nearly always results in overtorquing. A fastener does its 
job by stretching to near what is called its elastic limit. Once you 
exceed this, the fastener can never provide the clamping power it 
was designed to provide. And the clamping power is what allows 
that connection to be made tight. Once you exceed the elastic limit of 
a fastener, you have eliminated its ability to give you a reliable con-
nection. Overtorquing can eventually strip threads. But, this does 
not mean you are okay as long as you do not strip the threads. What 
matters is how far you stretched the fastener. Once you exceed the 
torque limit for that fastener, it will no longer fasten properly.
 13. Examine connections on wireways. For electrical metallic tubing 
(EMT), check that the coupling screws are not loose. Do not over-
tighten these. You cannot economically tighten conduit, as it is 
threaded together.
 14. For critical circuits, consider installing a bonding jumper around 
every metallic wireway connection. For example, install a bonding 
jumper around each conduit coupling or around each EMT fi tting.
 15. As already mentioned, remove any load-side N–G bonds.
12.6.3.5 Measurements at the Transformer
Transformers are subject to overheating from harmonic currents. Transformers 
supplying nonlinear loads should be checked periodically to verify opera-
tion is within acceptable limits. Transformers are also critical to the integrity 
of the grounding system. Table 12.12 lists the various measurements needed 
for transformers.

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
779
Measurements
Transformer loading (kVA): If the transformer has a four-wire wye secondary, 
which is the standard confi guration for commercial single-phase loads, actual 
kVA can be easily determined by measuring phase currents supplied from 
each winding and then calculating each kVA, or measuring directly the kVA 
in each phase. The sum of individual phase kVA then gives the  three-phase 
kVA of the transformer. Compare actual load kVA measured or calculated 
against nameplate kVA rating to determine % loading. If the load is balanced, 
a single measurement is suffi cient. Transformers loaded at less than 50% are 
generally safe from overheating. However, as loads increase, measurements 
should be made periodically. At some point the transformer may require der-
ating because of nonlinear loading.
Harmonic spectrum: The harmonic spectrum of the secondary (load) current 
will give an idea of the harmonic orders and amplitudes present:
In a transformer feeding single-phase loads, the principal harmonic of 
concern is the third. The third will add arithmetically in the neutral and 
circulate in the delta primary of a delta–wye transformer. The delta–wye 
connected transformer tends to isolate the rest of the system from the third 
harmonic currents from the primary system, however it does isolate the 
fi fth, seventh or other nontriplen harmonics. The third harmonic and

triplen harmonic current however will cause additional heating of the 
transformer.
In a transformer feeding three-phase loads which include drives or UPS sys-
tems with six-pulse converters, the fi fth and seventh harmonic will tend to pre-
dominate. Excessive fi fth is of particular concern because it is negative sequence. 
It will tend to produce counter-torque and overheating in polyphase motors.
Harmonic amplitudes normally decrease as the harmonic frequency goes 
up. If one frequency is signifi cantly higher in amplitude than lower frequen-
cies, we can suspect a resonant condition at that frequency. If such a condi-
tion is detected, be sure to take readings at capacitor banks to see if the caps 
are experiencing overcurrent/overvoltage conditions.
Before-and-after harmonic spectrum measurement is extremely valuable to 
determine if harmonic mitigation techniques, like trap fi lters, which are tuned 
to specifi c frequencies, are sized properly and are working as expected. Different 
harmonic frequencies affect equipment in different ways. See Table 12.13 for 
harmonic sequences and their effects on equipment.

Rule: If waveforms are symmetrical, even harmonics disappear.
Harmonics are classifi ed as follows:
 
1. Order or number: Multiple of fundamental, hence, third is three times the funda-
mental, or 180 Hz.
 
2. Odd or even order: Odd harmonics are generated during normal operation of non-
linear loads. Even harmonics only appear when there is DC in the system. In power 
circuits, this only tends to occur when a solid-state component(s), such as a diode or 
SCR, fails in a converter circuit.

a. Positive sequence. Main effect is overheating.
 
b.  Negative sequence. Create counter-torque in motors, i.e., will tend to make motors 
go backwards, thus causing motor overheating. Mainly fi fth harmonic.
 
c.  Zero sequence. Add in neutral of three-phase, four-wire system. Mainly third 
harmonic.

THD: Check for THD of both voltage and current:
For voltage, THD should not exceed 5%. For current, THD should not 
exceed 5%–20%.
IEEE 519 sets limits for harmonics at the point of common coupling (PCC) 
between the utility and customer (EN50160 is the European standard that is 
equivalent to the IEEE 519). IEEE 519 addresses THD measurements that are 
taken at the PCC which is usually considered to be the main transformer 
between the utility and the customer. Therefore the THD measurements are 
often made at the secondary of the customer’s main transformer, since that is 
the point most easily accessible to all parties. Some PQ practitioners have 
broadened the concept of PCC to include points inside the facility, such as on 
the feeder system, where harmonic currents being generated from one set of 
loads could affect another set of loads by causing signifi cant voltage distor-
tion. The emphasis is on improving in-plant PQ, rather than on simply not 
affecting utility PQ.
Voltage THD: THD has a long history in the industry. The underlying con-
cept is that harmonic currents generated by loads will cause voltage distor-
tion as they travel through the system impedance. This voltage distortion 
then becomes the carrier of harmonics system wide. If for example, the dis-
torted voltage serves a linear load like a motor, it will then create harmonic 
currents in that linear load. By setting maximum limits for voltage distortion, 
we set limits for the system-wide impact of harmonics.
Voltage distortion, however, depends on source impedance, i.e., on 
system capacity. It is quite possible for the first (or second or third) cus-
tomer to inject significant harmonic currents into the system and not 
cause voltage THD to exceed 5%. The entire responsibility for harmonic 
mitigation could fall on the last customers unlucky enough to push volt-
age THD over 5%, even if their particular harmonic load was relatively 
small.
Current THD: To restore some fairness to this situation, standards for maxi-
mum current harmonics were added, since current harmonics were under 
the control of the local facility and equipment manufacturer (remember, 
harmonic loads act as generators of harmonics). This emphasis on the mitiga-
tion of current harmonics at the load, including the not-too-distant require-
ment that the load generate virtually no harmonics, has become the prevailing 
regulatory philosophy. It puts the burden of responsibility on the local site 
and on the equipment manufacturers. For equipment manufacturers, 
EN50160, IEC/EN 61010, and IEC/EN 61000-4, are the applicable European 
 standards. To meet requirement for the European market, USA manufactur-
ers will have to meet the above listed standards. The limits set in IEEE 519 for 
harmonic currents depend on the size of the customer relative to the system 
capacity. The SCR is a measure of the electrical size of the customer in  relation 
to the utility source. The smaller the customer (higher SCR), the less the 
potential impact on the utility source and the more generous the harmonic 

782 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
limits. The larger the customer’s power system (smaller SCR), the more 
 stringent the limits on harmonic currents. Refer to Table 12.14 for current 
harmonic limits at the PCC.
Total demand distortion (TDD) and THD: TDD is the ratio of the current 
harmonics to the maximum load (IL). It differs from THD in that THD is the 
ratio of harmonics to the instantaneous load. Why TDD instead of THD? 
Suppose you were running a light load (using a small fraction of system 
capacity), but those loads were nonlinear. THD would be relatively high, 
but the harmonic currents actually being generated would be low, and the 
effect on the supply system would in fact be negligible. Therefore, TDD 
allows harmonic load to be referenced to the maximum load: if harmonic 
load is high at maximum load, then we have to watch out for the effect on 
the supply source. So where does that leave current THD as a useful mea-
surement. The closer the current THD reading(s) is taken to conditions of 
maximum load, the closer it approximates TDD. The one place not to apply 
the specs is at the  individual harmonic-generating load. This will always 
be a worst-case distortion and a misleading reading. This is because as 
 harmonics travel upstream, a certain amount of cancellation takes place 
(due to phase relationships which, for practical purposes, is diffi cult to 
 predict). THD and TDD should be measured at a PCC, or at the source 
transformer.
K-factor: K-factor is a specifi c measure of the heating effect of harmonics in 
general and on transformers in particular. It differs from the THD calcula-
tion in that it emphasizes the frequency as well as the amplitude of the 
harmonic order. This is because heating effects increase as the square of 
the frequency.

A K-4 reading would mean that the stray loss heating effects are four times 
normal. A standard transformer is, in effect, a K-1 transformer. As with THD, 
it is misleading to make a K-factor reading at the load or receptacle because 
there will be a certain amount of upstream cancellation; transformer K-factor 
is what counts. Once the K-factor is determined, choose the next higher trade 
size. K-factor rated transformers are available in standard trade sizes of K-4, 
K-13, K-20, K-30, etc. K-13 is a common rating for a transformer supplying 
offi ce loads. The higher ratings tend to be packaged into power distribution 
units (PDUs) which are specially designed to supply computer and other PQ 
sensitive installations. For additional information on K-rated transformer, 
refer to Section 12.5.2.1.
Ground currents: Two prime reasons for excessive ground current are  illegal 
N–G bonds (in subpanels, receptacles, or even in equipment) and so-called 
IG rods:
Subpanel N–G bonds create a parallel path for normal return current to 
return via the grounding conductor. If the neutral ever becomes open, the 
equipment safety ground becomes the only return path; if this return path is 
high impedance, dangerous voltages could develop.
Separate IG rods almost always create two ground references at different 
potentials, which in turn cause a ground loop current to circulate in an 
attempt to equalize those potentials. A safety and equipment hazard is also 
created: in the case of lightning strikes, surge currents traveling to ground at 
different earth potentials will create hazardous potential differences.
Transformer grounding: The proper grounding of the transformer is critical. 
NEC Article 250 in general and 250-26 in particular address the grounding 
requirements of the seperately derived systems (SDS).
A ground reference is established by a grounding connection, typically to 
building steel (which, in turn, is required to be bonded to all cold water pipe, 
as well as to any and all earth grounding electrodes). Bonding should be by 
exothermic weld, not clamps that can loosen over time. The grounding elec-
trode conductor itself should have as low a high-frequency impedance 
as possible (not least because fault current has high frequency components). 
Wide, fl at conductors are preferred to round ones because they have less 
inductive reactance at higher frequencies. For the same reason, the distance 
between the grounding electrode conductor connection to the system 
(i.e., N–G bond at the transformer) and the grounding electrode (building 
steel) should be as short as possible.
The neutral and ground should be connected at a point on the transformer 
neutral bus. Although permitted, it is not advisable to make the N–G bond at 
the main panel, in order to maintain the segregation of normal return cur-
rents and any ground currents. This point at the transformer is the only point 
on the system where N–G should be bonded. Refer to Table 12.15 for inspec-
tion of the transformer grounding related to PQ problems.

SDS: The distribution transformer is the supply for a SDS, a term which is 
defi ned in the NEC (Article 100). The key idea is that the secondary of this 
transformer is the new source of power for all its downstream loads: this is a 
powerful concept in developing a PQ distribution system. The SDS accom-
plishes several important objectives, all benefi cial for PQ:
It establishes a new voltage reference. Transformers have taps which 
• 
allow the secondary voltage to be stepped up or down to compen-
sate for any voltage drop on the feeders.
It lowers source impedance by decreasing, sometimes drastically, 
• 
the distance between the load and the source. The potential for volt-
age disturbances, notably sags, is minimized.
It achieves isolation. Since there is no electrical connection, only

magnetic coupling, between the primary and secondary, the SDS 
 isolates its loads from the rest of the electrical system. To extend this

If the conduit is not itself grounded, it will tend to 
act as a choke for higher frequencies and limit 
fault current (remember that fault currents are not 
just at 60 Hz but have high-f components)

Ideally there should be none, but there will always 
be some ground current due to normal operation 
or leakage of protective components (MOVs, etc.) 
connected from phase or neutral to ground.

for suspicion (there is no hard and fast rule, but

possible problems)

isolation to high frequency disturbances, specially constructed 
 isolation transformers provide a shield between the primary and 
secondary to shunt RF noise to ground. Otherwise, the capacitive 
coupling between primary and secondary would tend to pass these 
high-frequency signals right through.
A new ground reference is established. Part of the defi nition of the 
• 
SDS is that it “has no direct electrical connection, including a solidly 
connected grounded circuit conductor, to supply conductors origi-
nating in another system.” (NEC 100) The opportunity exists to seg-
regate the subsystem served by the SDS from ground loops and 
ground noise upstream from the SDS, and vice versa.
K-rated transformers: Harmonics cause heating in transformers, at a greater 
rate than the equivalent fundamental currents would. This is because of their 
higher frequency. There are three heating effects in transformers that increase 
with frequency
Hysteresis:
• 
 When steel is magnetized, magnetic dipoles all line 
up, so that the north poles all point one way, the south poles the 
other. These poles switch with the polarity of the applied current. 
The higher the frequency, the more often the switching occurs, 
and, in a process analogous to the effects of friction, heat losses 
increase.
Eddy currents:
• 
 Alternating magnetic fi elds create localized whirl-
pools of current that create heat loss. This effect increases as a 
square of the frequency. For example, a third harmonic current will 
have nine times the heating effect as the same current at the 
fundamental.
Skin effect
• 
. As frequency increases, electrons migrate to the outer 
surface of the conductor. More electrons are using less space, so the 
effective impedance of the conductor has increased; at the higher fre-
quency, the conductor behaves as if it were a lower gauge, lower 
ampacity, higher impedance wire. The industry has responded with 
two general solutions to the effects of harmonics on transformers: 
install a K-factor rated transformer or derate a standard transformer. 
Let us look at pros and cons of the K-factor approach fi rst. K-factor is a 
calculation based on the rms value, %HD of the harmonic  currents, 
and the square of the harmonic order (number). It is not necessary to 
actually perform the calculation because a harmonic analyzer will do 
that for you. The important thing to understand is that the harmonic 
order is squared in the equation and that is precisely where the high-
frequency heating effects, like eddy current losses, are taken into 
account. K-rated transformers are designed to minimize and accom-
modate the heating effects of harmonics. K-rated transformers do not 
eliminate harmonics (unless additional  elements like fi lters are added). 

786 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
They accommodate harmonics with techniques such as the use of a 
number of smaller, parallel windings instead of a single large winding: 
this gives more skin for the  electrons to travel on. The primary delta 
winding is up-sized to tolerate the circulating third harmonic currents 
without overheating. The neutral on the secondary is also up-sized for 
third harmonics (typically sized at twice the phase ampacity).
Application issues with K-factor transformers: K-rated transformers have 
been widely applied, but there are certain issues with them. Many consul-
tants do not see the need for using transformers with a rating higher than 
K-13 although K-20 and higher might be supplied as part of an integrated 
PDU. Also, early applications sometimes overlooked the fact that K-rated 
transformers necessarily have a lower internal impedance. Whereas a 
standard transformer has an impedance typically in the 5%–6% range, 
K-rated transformers can go as low as 2%–3% (lower as the K-rating 
increases). In retrofi t situations, where a standard transformer is being 
replaced by a K-rated  transformer of equivalent kVA, this may require 
new short-circuit calculations and resizing of the secondary overcurrent 
protective devices.
Derating standard transformers: Some facilities managers use a 50% derating 
as a rule-of thumb for their transformers serving single-phase, predomi-
nantly nonlinear loads. This means that a 150 kVA transformer would only 
supply 75 kVA of load. The derating curve (see Figure 12.23), taken from IEEE 
1100-1992 (Emerald Book), shows that a transformer with 60% of its loads 
consisting of SMPS, which is certainly possible in a commercial offi ce build-
ing, should in fact be derated by 50%. The following is an accepted method 
for calculating transformer derating for single-phase loads only. It is based 
on the very reasonable assumption that in single-phase circuits, the third

harmonic will predominate and cause the distorted current waveform to 
look predictably peaked. Use a true-rms meter to make these current 
measurements:
 
1. Measure rms and peak current of each secondary phase. (Peak refers to 
the instantaneous peak, not to the inrush or peak load rms current).
 
2. Find the arithmetic average of the three rms readings and the three 
peak currents and use this average in step 3 (if the load is essentially 
balanced, this step is not necessary).
 
3. Calculate xformer harmonic derating factor:
 
xHDF = (1.414 * Irms)/Ipeak
 
4. Or, since the ratio of peak/rms is defi ned as CF, this equation can be 
rewritten as:
 
xHDF = 1.414/CF
If the test instrument has the capability, measure the CF of each phase 
directly. If the load is unbalanced, fi nd the average of the three phases and 
use the average in the above formula. Since a sine wave current waveform 
has a CF = 1.414, it will have an xHDF = 1; there will be no derating. The more 
the third harmonic, the higher the peak, the higher the CF. If the CF were 2.0, 
then the xHDF = 1.414/2 = 0.71. A CF = 3 gives us an xHDF = 0.47. A wave 
with CF = 3 is about as badly distorted a current waveform as you can expect 
to see on a single-phase distribution transformer.
Caution: This method does not apply to transformers feeding three-phase 
loads, where harmonics other than the third tend to predominate and CF is 
not useful as a simple predictor of the amount of distortion. A calculation for 
three-phase loads is available in ANSI/IEEE C57.110. However, there is some 
controversy about this calculation since it may underestimate the mechanical 
resonant vibrations that harmonics can cause, and that accelerate  transformer 
wear above and beyond the effects of heat alone.
12.6.3.6 Electrical Noise
Electrical noise is the result of more or less random electrical signals get-
ting coupled into circuits where they are unwanted, i.e., where they  disrupt 
information-carrying signals. Noise occurs on both power and signal 
 circuits, but generally speaking, it becomes a problem when it gets on 
signal circuits. Signal and data circuits are particularly vulnerable to noise 
because they operate at fast speeds and with low voltage levels. The lower 
the signal voltage, the less the amplitude of the noise voltage that can be 
tolerated.
The signal-to-noise ratio describes how much noise a circuit can tolerate 
before the valid information, the signal, becomes corrupted. Noise is one of 
the more mysterious subjects in PQ, especially since it must be considered 

788 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
with its equally mysterious, grounding. To lessen the mystery, there are two 
key concepts to understand:
The fi rst is that electrical effects do not require direct connection 
• 
(such as through copper conductors) to occur. For an electrician 
who’s been trained to size, install and test wiring, this may not be 
intuitive. Yet think of lightning, or of the primary and secondary of 
an isolation transformer, or of the radio antenna: there is no direct, 
hard-wired connection, but somehow complete electrical circuits 
are still happening. The same electrical rules-of-behavior are in 
operation for noise coupling, as will be explained later.
The second concept is that we can no longer stay in the realm of 
• 
60 Hz. One of the benefi ts of 60 Hz is that it is a low enough fre-
quency that power circuits can be treated (almost) like DC circuits; 
in other words, basic Ohm’s law applies. But when it comes to noise, 
we need to keep in mind that signal circuits occur at high frequen-
cies, that noise is typically a broad spectrum of frequencies, and that 
we need to consider the frequency-dependent behavior of potential 
sources of noise.
Coupling mechanisms: There are four basic mechanisms of noise coupling 
(see Figure 12.24). It pays to understand them and how they differ one from 
the other because a lot of the troubleshooter’s job will be to identify which 
coupling effect is dominant in a particular situation.
Capacitive coupling: This is often referred to as electrostatic noise and is a volt-
age-based effect, lightning discharge is just an extreme example. Any  conductors

separated by an insulating material (including air) constitute a capacitor—in 
other words, capacitance is an inseparable part of any circuit. The potential for 
capacitive coupling increases as frequency increases (capacitive reactance, which 
can be thought of as the resistance to capacitive coupling, decreases with 
frequency).
Inductive coupling: This is magnetic-coupled noise and is a current-based 
effect. Every conductor with current fl owing through it has an associated 
magnetic fi eld. A changing current can induce current in another circuit, 
even if that circuit is a single loop; in other words, the source circuit acts as 
a transformer primary with the victim circuit being the secondary. The 
inductive coupling effect increases with the following factors: (1) larger cur-
rent fl ow, (2) faster rate of change of current, (3) proximity of the two con-
ductors (primary and secondary), and (4) the more the adjacent conductor 
resembles a coil (round diameter as opposed to fl at, or coiled as opposed to 
straight). Here are some examples of how inductive coupling can cause 
noise in power circuits:
Noise in power circuits: A transient surge, especially if it occurs on a high-
energy circuit, causes a very fast change in current which can couple into an 
adjacent conductor. Lightning surges are a worst case, but common switch-
ing transients or arcing can do the same thing.
If feeder cables are positioned such that there is a net magnetic fi eld, 
• 
then currents can be induced into ground cables that share the 
raceway.
It is well-known that signal wires and power conductors should not 
• 
be laid parallel to each other in the same raceway, which would max-
imize their inductive coupling, but instead be separated and crossed 
at right angles when necessary. Input and output cables should also 
be isolated from each other in the same manner. Magnetic fi elds are 
isolated by effective shielding. The material used must be capable of 
conducting magnetic fi elds (ferrous material as opposed to copper). 
The reason that a dedicated circuit (hot, neutral, and ground) should 
be run in its own metal conduit when possible is that is in effect 
magnetically shielded to minimize inductive coupling effects. Both 
inductive and capacitive coupling are referred to as near fi eld effects, 
since they dominate at short distances and distance decreases their 
coupling effects. This helps explain one of the mysteries of noise—
how slight physical repositioning of wiring can have such major 
effects on coupled noise.
Conducted noise: While all coupled noise ends up as conducted noise, this 
term is generally used to refer to noise that is coupled by a direct, galvanic 
(metallic) connection. Included in this category are circuits that have shared 
conductors (such as shared neutrals or grounds). Conducted noise could be 
high frequency, but may also be 60 Hz. These are some common examples of 
connections that put objectionable noise currents directly onto the ground:

790 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Subpanels with extra N–G bonds.
• 
Receptacles miswired with N and G switched.
• 
Equipment with internal solid-state protective devices that have 
• 
shorted from line or neutral to ground, or that have not failed but 
have normal leakage current. This leakage current is limited by UL 
to 3.5 mA for plug-connected equipment, but there is no limit for 
permanently wired equipment with potentially much higher leak-
age currents. (Leakage currents are easy to identify because they 
will disappear when the device is turned off).
Another common example is the so-called IG rod. When it is at a dif-
• 
ferent earth potential than the source grounding electrode, a ground 
loop current occurs. This is still conducted noise, even though the 
direct connection is through the earth.
Datacom connections that provide a metallic path from one terminal 
• 
to another can also conduct noise. In the case of single-ended, unbal-
anced connections (RS-232), the connection to terminal ground is 
made at each end of the cable. This offers a path for ground currents 
if the equipment at each end is referenced to a different power source 
with a different ground.
RFI: RFI ranges from 10 kHz to the 10s of MHz (and higher). At these 
frequencies, lengths of wire start acting like transmitting and receiving 
antennas. The culprit circuit acts as a transmitter and the victim circuit is 
acting as a receiving antenna. RFI, like the other coupling mechanisms, is a 
fact of life, but it can be controlled (not without some thought and effort, 
however).
RFI noise reduction employs a number of strategies:
Fiber optic cable, of course, is immune to electrical noise.
• 
Shielded cabling (such as coax cables) attempts to break the coupling 
• 
between the noise and signal.
Balanced circuits (such as twisted pair) do not break the coupling, 
• 
but instead take advantage of the fact that the RFI will be coupled 
into both conductors (signal and return). This noise (called CM noise) 
is then subtracted, while the signal is retained. In effect, the balanced 
circuit creates a high impedance for the coupled noise.
Another example of the high-impedance-to-noise approach is the 
• 
use of RF chokes. Whether used with data or power cables, RF chokes 
can offer effective high-frequency impedance (XL increases with 
frequency).
A low-impedance path can be used to shunt away the noise. This 
• 
is the principle behind fi ltering and the use of decoupling caps 
(low impedance to high frequency, but open at power line frequen-
cies). But a sometimes over looked, yet critical, aspect is that the 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
791
ground path and plane must be capable of handling high-fre-
quency currents. High-frequency grounding techniques are used 
to accomplish this. The SRG, fi rst developed for raised fl oor com-
puter room installations, is an effective solution. It is essentially an 
equipotential ground plane at high frequency.
Signal grounding: To understand the importance of clean signal grounds, let 
us discuss the distinction between DM versus CM signals. Imagine a basic 
two-wire circuit: supply and return. Any current that circulates or any volt-
age read across a load between the two wires is called DM (the terms normal 
mode, transverse mode, and signal mode are also used). The DM signal is 
typically the desired signal (just like 120 V at a receptacle). Imagine a third 
conductor, typically a grounding conductor. Any current that fl ows now 
through the two original conductors and returns on this third conductor is 
common to both of the original conductors. The CM current is the noise that 
the genuine signal has to overcome. CM is all that extra traffi c on the high-
way. It could have gotten there through any of the coupling mechanisms, 
such as magnetic fi eld coupling at power line frequency or RFI at higher fre-
quencies. The point is to control or minimize these ground or CM currents, to 
make life easier for the DM currents.
Measurement: CM currents can be measured with current clamps using the 
zero-sequence technique. The clamp circles the signal pair (or, in a three-
phase circuit, all three-phase conductors and the neutral, if any). If signal 
and return current are equal, their equal and opposite magnetic fi elds cancel. 
Any current read must be CM; in other words, any current read is current 
that is not returning on the signal wires, but via a ground path. This tech-
nique applies to signal as well as power conductors. For fundamental cur-
rents, a clamp meter or digital multimeter (DMM) + clamp would suffi ce, but 
for higher frequencies, a high bandwidth instrument like the Fluke 43 PQ 
analyzer or scope meter should be used with a clamp accessory.
12.6.3.7 Transients
Transients should be distinguished from surges. Surges are a special case of 
high-energy transient which result from lightning strikes (see Section 12.6.3.8). 
Voltage transients are lower energy events, typically caused by equipment 
switching. They are harmful in a number of ways:
They deteriorate solid-state components. Sometimes a single high-
• 
energy transient will puncture a solid-state junction, sometimes 
repetitive low-energy transients will accomplish the same thing. 
For example, transients which exceed the PIV rating of diodes are 
a common cause of diode failure.
Their high-frequency component (fast rise times) cause them to be 
• 
capacitively coupled into adjoining conductors. If those conductors 

792 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
are carrying digital logic, that logic will get trashed. Transients also 
couple across transformer windings unless special shielding is pro-
vided. Fortunately this same high-frequency component causes 
transients to be relatively localized, since they are damped (attenu-
ated) by the impedance of the conductors (inductive reactance 
increases with frequency).
Utility capacitor switching transients are an example of a com-
• 
monly occurring high-energy transient (still by no means in the 
class of lightning) that can affect loads at all levels of the distribu-
tion system. They are a well known cause of nuisance tripping of 
VFDs (ASDs): they have enough energy to drive a transient cur-
rent into the DC link of the drive and cause an overvoltage trip. 
Transients can be categorized by waveform. The fi rst category 
is impulsive transients, commonly called spikes, because a high-
frequency spike protrudes from the waveform. The cap switching 
transient, on the other hand, is an oscillatory transient because a 
ringing waveform rides on and distorts the normal waveform. It is 
lower frequency, but higher energy.
Causes: Transients are unavoidable. They are created by the fast switching 
of relatively high currents. For example, an inductive load like a motor will 
create a kickback spike when it is turned off. In fact, removing a Wiggy 
(a solenoid voltage tester) from a high-energy circuit can create a spike of 
thousands of volts. A capacitor, on the other hand, creates a momentary short 
circuit when it is turned on. After this sudden collapse of the applied voltage, 
the voltage rebounds and an oscillating wave occurs. Not all  transients are 
the same, but as a general statement, load switching causes transients. 
In offi ces, the laser copier/printer is a well-recognized “bad guy” on the 
offi ce branch circuit. It requires an internal heater to kick in whenever it is 
used and every 30 s or so when it is not used. This constant switching has two 
effects: the current surge or inrush can cause repetitive voltage sags; the rapid 
changes in current also generate transients that can affect other loads on the 
same branch.
Measurement and recording: Transients can be captured by digital storage 
oscilloscopes (DSOs). The Fluke 43 PQ analyzer, which includes DSO func-
tions, has the ability to capture, store and subsequently display up to 40 tran-
sient waveforms. Events are tagged with time and date stamps (real-time 
stamps). Another voltage event recorder, such as Fluke’s VR101S will also 
capture transients at the receptacle.
Peak voltage and real-time stamps are provided.
TVS suppressors (TVSS): Fortunately, transient protection is not expensive. 
Virtually all electronic equipment has (or should have) some level of protec-
tion built in. One commonly used protective component is the MOV which 
clips the excess voltage. TVSS are applied to provide additional transient pro-
tection. TVSS are low voltage (600 V) devices and are tested and certifi ed to UL 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
793
1449. UL 1449 rates TVSS devices by grade, class, and mode. As an example, the 
highest rating for a TVSS would be grade A (6000 V, 3000 A), class 1  (let-through 
voltage of 330 V max), and mode 1 (L–N suppression). The proper rating should 
be chosen based on the load’s protection needs:
A lower grade might result in a TVSS that lasts 1 year instead of 
• 
10 years. The solid-state components in a TVSS will themselves dete-
riorate as they keep on taking hits from transients.
A lower class might permit too much let-through voltage that could 
• 
damage the load. Class 1 is recommended for SMPS.
A mode 2 device would pass transients to ground, where they could 
• 
disrupt electronic circuit operation.

voltage susceptibility profi le for manufacturers of computers and other 
sensitive equipment. Similar curves are being developed for 230 V/50 Hz 
equipment and for ASDs. Sensitive equipment should be able to survive 
events inside the curve. Events outside of the curve could require addi-
tional power conditioning equipment or other remedial action. A major 
change in ITIC is that the ride-through times for outages as well as the toler-
ance for sags have both been increased. The fi eld troubleshooter must keep in 
mind that the  profi les are recommendations and that a particular piece of 
equipment may or may not match the profi le. The profi les are useful because, 
when recorded events are plotted against them, they give a general idea of 
the voltage quality at a particular site.
12.6.3.8 Lightning
Lightning protection plays a vital part in the overall PQ of an installation. 
Lightning occurrence varies by geography, with Florida being the lightning 
capital of the United States. Lightning does not have to score a direct hit to 
be disruptive. It has so much energy that it couples surges into conductors, 
both those exposed to air and those buried in the ground. Basic lightning 
protection has two main requirements:
Effective grounding: A low impedance of the grounding electrode system to 
earth is important. But, equally important is that all parts of the grounding 
system be bonded together: all ground electrodes are bonded (and extraneous 
ground rods removed), structural steel is tied to service entrance ground, all 
grounding connections are tight and free of corrosion, etc. This  minimizes 
the phenomenon called transferred earth potential, where large surge 
currents create large voltage differences between two ground points with 
different impedances to earth. This same grounding practice is important 
for performance reasons, as it tends to minimize ground loop currents that 
circulate in an attempt to equalize ground potentials.
Surge arrestors: A surge arrestor “is a protective device for limiting surge 
voltages by discharging or bypassing surge current…,” per NEC Article 
280. Since the surge current is bypassed to ground, surge arrestors are only 
as effective as the grounding system. Surge arrestors are sized for the loca-
tion where they are installed. Three categories are defi ned (ANSI/IEEE 
C62.41-2002).
A surge arrestor at an outside installation is closest to the lightning event 
and must absorb most of the energy. This is considered a Category C location 
(corresponding to CAT IV in IEC 61010). Category B refers to feeders and 
distribution panels (equivalent to CAT III in IEC 61010), and Category A 
refers to receptacle connected surge arrestors (equivalent to CAT II).
Surge arrestor or TVSS: A surge arrestor is there to protect the insulation and, 
ultimately, prevent failures that could lead to fi res. It is not necessarily designed 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
795
to protect sensitive equipment. That’s the job of the TVSS. Refer to an inspec-
tion guide on Inspection of Lightning Protection System which is given in 
Table 12.16.
12.6.3.9 Polyphase Induction Motors
About two-thirds of the electric power in the United States is consumed by 
motors, with industrial three-phase motors above 5 hp (7 kW) being by far 
the bulk of that load. They are linear loads and therefore do not contribute to 
harmonics. They are, however, the major contributor to reduced DPF, which 
is a measurement of the effective use of system capacity.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Measurements
Voltage unbalance: Voltage unbalance should not exceed 1%–2% (unless the 
motor is lightly loaded). The reason for such a small tolerance for voltage 
unbalance is because it has a very large effect on current unbalance, in 
the neighborhood of 8:1. In other words, a voltage unbalance of 1% can cause 
current unbalance of 8%. Current unbalance will cause the motor to draw 
more current than it otherwise would. Also, the unbalance voltage being 
delivered to motor terminals will cause the fl ow of negative sequence cur-
rents. Negative sequence currents produce opposing torque which the motor 
has to overcome therefore it will draw more current, thereby overheating the 
motor. For example a 3% voltage unbalance raises the motor winding 
temperature by 25% (refer to Section 10.10 in Chapter 10). The net effect of 
voltage unbalance is more heat and heat is the enemy of motor life, since it 
deteriorates the winding insulation.
Voltage unbalance can be caused by severe load unbalance but it could just 
as easily be caused by loose connections and worn contacts. Example of volt-
age unbalance calculation can be made as follows:

Voltage %THD and harmonic spectrum: Voltage THD should not exceed 5% 
on any phase. If the voltage distortion on any phase is excessive, it can cause 
current unbalance. The usual culprit is the fi fth harmonic and therefore the 
harmonic spectrum should be examined for the fi fth in particular. The fi fth 
is a negative sequence harmonic which creates counter-torque in the motor. 
A motor fed by a voltage with high fi fth harmonic content will tend to draw 
more current than otherwise. This is a major problem when across-the-line 
or soft-start motors share the same bus with VFDs.
Current unbalance: To fi nd current unbalance, measure amps in all three 
phases. Do the same calculation as for voltage unbalance. In general, current 
unbalance should not exceed 10%. However, unbalance can usually be toler-
ated if the high leg reading does not exceed the nameplate full load amps 
(FLA) and service factor (SF). The FLA and SF are available on the motor 
nameplate. If the voltage unbalance and the voltage THD are within limits, 
high current unbalance can be an indication of motor problems, such as 
damaged winding insulation or uneven air gaps. Current measurement will 
also fi nd single-phasing. If a three-phase motor loses a phase (perhaps 
caused by a blown fuse or loose connection), it may still try to run single-
phase off the remaining two phases. Since the motor acts like a constant 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
797
power device, it will simply draw additional current in an attempt to pro-
vide suffi cient torque. A voltage measurement alone will not necessarily 
fi nd this condition, since voltage is induced by the two powered windings 
into the nonpowered winding.
Loading: Measure current draw of the motor. If the motor is at or near its 
FLA rating (times the SF multiplier), it will be more sensitive to the addi-
tional heating from harmonics, as well as current unbalance. A motor that is 
only lightly loaded is usually safe from overheating. On the other hand, its 
effi ciency and DPF are both less than optimal. Most motors reach maximum 
effi ciency at 60%–80% of full load rating. DPF is maximum at rated load 
(including SF) and drops off, especially at less than 80% of rated load. This 
leads to the conclusion that, to the degree a motor load is constant and pre-
dictable, 80% of rated load is the most effi cient operating range.
Inrush (lock rotor current): Motors which are started across-the-line 
(as opposed to those using soft-starts or drives) draw a current inrush, 
also called locked rotor current. This inrush tapers off to normal running 
current as the motor comes up to speed.
Older motors draw an inrush of typically 500%–600% of the running 
• 
current. Newer energy effi cient designs draw brief inrushes as high 
as 1200% of running current, a direct result of the lower impedances 
which help make them more energy effi cient in the fi rst place.
High torque, high horse power motor loads require proportionally 
• 
higher inrush.
Motor loads started at the same time will have a cumulative inrush. 
• 
Another source of inrush is UPS and VFD systems with diode convert-
ers. They draw inrush current as their capacitor banks fi rst charge.
Effects of inrush current:
 
1. Inrush causes voltage sags if the source voltage is not stiff enough. 
Therefore, relays and contactor coils might drop out (typically, the sag 
would have to get as bad as about 70% of normal line voltage); or, if they 
hold in, their contacts might chatter (especially if the additional load 
causes a long-term undervoltage). Control circuits might reset or lockup 
(at 90% and below). Drives might trip off-line (undervoltage trip).
 
2. High peak demand periods, which may cause higher utility bills.
 
3. Cycling loads can cause periodic sags, which might show up as fl ick-
ering lights.
 
4. If the motor is required to start up a high torque load, the inrush can 
be relatively prolonged (e.g., 10 to 20 s or more) and this can cause 
nuisance tripping as the overload heaters trip the motor starter.
PF: If the PF of the motor is low, it can be improved by applying capacitors 
to supply the required reactive volt-amperes (kVAR). To size PF correction

capacitors, it is necessary to measure the DPF and active power consump-
tion (kW) of the motor load. These measurements assume that the motor 
voltage and current are balanced. Therefore, before undertaking PF correc-
tion, fi rst make sure that voltage and current unbalance are within limits. 
Either problem can shorten motor life and should take priority over DPF 
correction.
12.6.3.10 PQ Measurements of VFDs
AC VFDs can be both a source and a victim of poor PQ. VFDs are also referred 
to as ASDs. Although ASDs are usually depicted as the culprit in the PQ sce-
nario, there are ways in which they can be a victim load as well. ASDs can be 
affected as follows.
Capacitor switching transients: High-energy (relatively low frequency) tran-
sients that are characteristic of utility capacitor switching can pass through 
the service transformer, feeders, and converter front-end of the drive directly 
to the DC link bus, where it will often cause a DC link overvoltage trip. Input 
diodes could also be blown out by these transients.
Voltage distortion: If high-voltage distortion shows up as excessive fl at-topping, 
it will prevent DC link capacitors from charging fully and will diminish the 
ride-through capability of the drive. Thus a voltage sag which would not 
normally affect a drive will cause the drive to trip on undervoltage.
Grounding: Improper grounding will affect the internal control circuits of 
the drive, with unpredictable results.
ASDs as culprit loads: A drive can defi nitely be a culprit load and have a 
major impact on system PQ. But before discussing the problems, let us put 
in perspective the positive effects of drives on PQ. First of all, they offer 
built-in soft-start capabilities. This means there will be no inrush current 
and no voltage sag effect on the rest of the system. Second, if the drive is of 
the PWM type, with a diode converter front-end, the DPF is high (com-
monly >95% at rated load) and more or less constant throughout the range. 
This means that drives can reduce energy usage and correct for DPF at the 
same time. It is a good thing too, because drives and PF correction capaci-
tors do not mix. Capacitors are vulnerable to the higher frequency harmonic 
currents generated by drives, since their impedance decreases as frequency 
increases. The type of drive has a major impact on the PQ symptoms, 
because of the different converter designs (converters or rectifi ers turn AC 
to DC and are the fi rst stage of the drive). There are two major types of con-
verter design.
1. SCR converter with VSI/variable voltage inverter (VVI) drives
Commonly called six-step drives, they use SCRs in their converter front-ends 
(the following discussion also applies to CSI drives, which also use SCRs). 
VSI (Figure 12.26) and CSI drive designs tended to be applied on larger drives

(>100 hp). SCR converters control the DC link voltage by switching on (or 
gating) current fl ow for a portion of the applied sine wave and switching off 
at the zero-crossing points. Unlike diodes, SCRs require control circuits for 
gate fi ring.
For the SCR converter, there are three main issues that affect line-side PQ:
Commutation notches. SCR switching or commutation is such that 
• 
there are brief moments when two phases will both be “ON.” This 
causes what is in effect a momentary short circuit that tends to 
 collapse the line voltage. This shows up as notches on the voltage 
waveform. These notches cause both high V-THD and transients. 
The solution is to place a reactor coil or isolation transformer in series 
with the drive’s front end to clean up both problems.
DPF declines as drive speed decreases. This is not as serious a prob-
• 
lem as it sounds, because the power requirement of the drive-motor-
load decreases even more.
Harmonic currents, typically the fi fth and seventh, are generated by 
• 
VSI drives.
2. Diode converter with PWM drives
The other and more common converter design uses diodes and is used in the 
PWM drive (Figure 12.27). The diodes require no switching control circuitry. 
One of the main trends in the industry has been the proliferation of PWM 
drives, mainly due to the continued development of fast switching, effi cient 
insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) used in the inverter section of the 
drive (inverters turn DC to AC). For all practical purposes, PWM drives are 
the industry standard. For the diode converter, the main PQ issue is harmon-
ics. The actual harmonic orders being generated depend on the number of

diodes in the front end. For three-phase conversion, a minimum set of six 
diodes is required. This six-pulse converter will generate fi fth and seventh 
harmonics. If a 12-pulse converter were used, the 11th and 13th harmonics 
will be generated instead of the fi fth and sixth—and, very importantly, for 
the same load, the amplitude of the 11th and 13th would be considerably less 
than the 5th and 6th. Therefore, the THD would be less. The vast majority of 
drives, however, are six-pulse PWM style, which is one reason we see so 
much fi fth  harmonic on the system.
Harmonics solutions: There are a number of solutions to mitigating 
 drive-generated harmonics. They are the following:
1. Harmonic trap fi lters (Figure 12.28)
These are typically LC networks connected in parallel at the source of the 
harmonics (in other words, at the drive input). They are tuned to just below 
the fi fth harmonic (typically 280 Hz) and will tend to sink both fi fth and much 
of the seventh harmonic. Obviously, they must be sized to the harmonic-
generating load.
2. Phase-shift transformers
This can be as simple as a delta–wye transformer feeding one drive(s) and a 
delta–delta feeding another drive(s). There is a 30° phase-shift effect between 
these two confi gurations, which effectively results in cancellation of har-
monics at the closest upstream PCC. The cancellation effect is optimal when 
both loads are more or less equal.
12.6.3.11 Power System Resonance
Is it possible to install PF correction capacitors and have PF get worse? 
It  certainly is and a starting place to understanding this puzzle lies in the 
 distinction between DPF and total PF. The penalty for not understanding the

difference can be blown capacitors and wasted investment. Total PF and DPF 
are the same in one basic sense: they are the ratio of real power to apparent 
power, or watts to VA. DPF is the classic concept of PF. It can be considered as 
the PF at the fundamental frequency. Total PF now includes the effects of 
fundamental and of harmonic currents (it is also referred to as true PF or 
DPF) (see Figure 12.13). It follows that with the presence of harmonics, PF is 
always lower than DPF and is also a more accurate description of total system 
effi ciency than DPF alone. Strictly speaking, the term PF refers to total PF, but 
in practice can also be used to refer to DPF. Needless to say, this introduces 
some confusion into discussions of PF. You have to be clear which one you are 
talking about.
DPF: Lower DPF is caused by motor loads which introduce the need for 
reactive power (VARs). The system has to have the capacity, measured in VA 
to supply both VARs and watts. The more VARs needed, the larger the 
VA requirement and the smaller the DPF. The cost of VARs is accounted for 
in a PF penalty charge.
Utilities often levy additional charges for DPF below a certain level; the 
actual DPF number varies, but typical numbers are 0.85 to 0.9. To reduce 
VARs caused by motor loads, PF correction capacitors are installed. Upstream 
system capacity, both in the plant and at the utility level, is released and avail-
able for other uses (Figure 12.29). Historically, this has been the gist of the PF 
story: a relatively well-known problem with a relatively straightforward 
solution.
Harmonics and capacitors: Harmonics have had a dramatic impact on the 
application of PF correction. The motor and capacitor loads described above 
are all linear and for all practical purposes generate no harmonics. Nonlinear 
Line

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
loads such as VFDs, on the other hand, do generate harmonic currents. Take 
a plant which is step-by-step putting VFDs on its motor loads.
VFDs generate signifi cant harmonic currents (fi fth and seventh on six-pulse 
converter drives). Suddenly the fuses on existing PF correction caps start 
blowing. Since these are three-phase caps, only one of the three fuses might 
blow. Now you have got unbalanced currents, possibly  unbalanced volt-
ages. The electrician replaces the fuses. They blow again. He puts in larger 
fuses. Now the fuses survive, but the capacitor blows. He replaces the capac-
itor. Same thing happens. What is going on? Harmonics are higher frequency 
currents and higher the frequency, the lower the impedance of a cap. The 
cap acts like a sink for harmonic currents.
Power system resonance: In a worst-case scenario, the inductive reactance 
(XL) of the transformer and the capacitive reactance (XC) of the PF correc-
tion cap form a parallel resonant circuit: XL = XC at a resonant frequency 
which is the same as or close to a harmonic frequency. The harmonic cur-
rent generated by the load excites the circuit into oscillation. Currents that 
are many times greater than the exciting current then circulate within this 
circuit. This so-called tank circuit can severely damage equipment, and it 
will also cause a drop in PF. This resonant condition often appears only 
when the system is lightly loaded, because the damping effect of resistive 
loads is removed. In other words, we have what the audio buffs call a high 
Q circuit. (Figure 12.30).
Start with harmonics mitigation: The correct solution path starts with mea-
suring and mitigating the harmonics generated by the drives. Harmonic trap 
fi lters would generally be called for. These trap fi lters are installed locally on 
the line side of the drive. Their effect is very much like the traditional PF 
 correction cap, in two senses: they reduce DPF as well as PF, and also they

localize the circulation of the problem harmonics (generally the fi fth). 
Harmonics mitigation and traditional DPF correction should be addressed as 
one systems issue. In other words, manage total PF, not just DPF.
12.6.3.12 Commercial Lighting Load
Lighting loads are a major load for many large facilities. Evaluating these 
circuits is important for both energy conservation and PQ (see Table 12.17). 
Keep in mind that commercial lighting loads are wired single phase, with the 
loads connected from phase-to-neutral. Typically, the phase-to-phase 
voltage is 480 V, with the phase-to-neutral voltage at 277 V. Measurements 
must be taken at the lighting panel, one phase at a time, since power con-
sumption and PF could vary on each phase. Consider the following factors 
from the PQ perspective.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Power consumption: Excessive phase unbalance can cause voltage unbal-
ance, which in turn can affect three-phase motor loads.
PF: Ballast with low PF might have lower cost-of-purchase but higher cost-
of-operation.
THD: Current THD should be considered when selecting ballast, especially 
if there is a possibility of transformer overloading.
Voltage stability: The sags and swells mode of the Fluke 43 (or similar instru-
ment) is especially useful for recording repetitive voltage sags which can 
show up as fl ickering lights. Both current and voltage are monitored simul-
taneously (Figure 12.31). This helps us to tell if sags are downstream of the 
measuring point (load related) or upstream (source related). For example, if 
voltage sags while current swells, a downstream current inrush likely caused 
the sag. If both voltage and current sag at the same time then some event 
upstream has caused the sags. It could be an upstream load like a motor on 
a parallel branch circuit which drew down the feeder voltage. Or it could be 
source voltage related, for example, a lightning strike or breaker trip/reclo-
sure on the utility distribution system.

Lightning: Can be extremely destructive if proper surge protection is not 
installed. It also causes sags and undervoltages on the utility line if far 
away. If close by, it causes swells and overvoltages. But in the fi nal analy-
sis, lightning is an act of nature and not in the same category as the 
damage man does to himself.
Utility automatic breaker reclosure: Causes short duration sags/outages, but 
better than the alternative, a longer-term outage.
Utility capacitor switching: Causes a high-energy voltage disturbance (looks 
like an oscillating transient riding on the wave). If the cap bank is near the 
facility, this transient can propagate all through the building.
Facility without enough distribution transformers: Trying to cut corners in the 
wrong places; running 208 V feeder up 20 stories is not the road to PQ.
Gen-sets not sized for harmonic loads: Excessive voltage distortion affects elec-
tronic control circuits. If SCR converter loads are present, notching can affect 
frequency control circuits.
PF correction capacitors and the effects of harmonics: Harmonics and caps do 
not mix. Those bulging capacitors are crying for help.
Inrush currents from high torque motor: Causes voltage sags if the load is too 
large or the source impedance too great. Staggered motor starts can help.
Undersized neutrals at panelboard: In the era of the third harmonic currents, 
neutrals can easily carry as much current or more current than the phase 
conductors. Keeping undersized neutral leads to overheated neutral and 
lugs, potential fi re hazards, and high N–G voltage.
Running power and signal cables together: Think of the signal cable as a 
single-wire transformer secondary and the power cable as the primary. The 
opportunities for coupling are endless.
Loose conduit connections and lack of green wire grounding conductor: Causes 
open or high impedance ground circuit. Not good for PQ or safety.
Hi-frequency noise: The most effective high frequency grounding technique 
is the installation of a SRG.
IG rods (Figure 12.32): They are a safety hazard because the earth is a high 
impedance path and will prevent enough current from fl owing to trip the 
breaker. They also cause ground loops; after all, every electron still has 
to go back where it came from. Further, if a person comes in contact with 
the ground where the step potential is high because of the high impedance 
path of the earth, the person will get shocked, injured or killed. One of 
the great mysteries of PQ is how some manufacturers get away with insist-
ing that their equipment warranty is void unless an IG rod is installed. 
This installation is in violation of the NEC requirements for single point 
grounding.

Shared neutrals on branch circuits: Causes load interaction and overloaded 
neutrals.
Laser printers and copiers sharing branch circuits with sensitive loads: Guaran-
teed periodic voltage sags and switching transients.

common in most facilities. Guaranteed to put return currents on the ground

is it a PQ problem, it is a plumbing problem. Circulating ground currents 
cause corrosion of water pipes.
12.7 PQ Solution and Power Treatment Devices
In Sections 12.1 through 12.5, we discussed concepts, origins, characteristics 
and effects of voltage disturbances, and HDs on power system equipment. 
In Section 12.6 a predictive maintenance and troubleshooting guide was pre-
sented to identify and quantify the PQ-related problems. Once the PQ prob-
lem is identifi ed and its effects on power equipment are understood, the next 
obvious step is to fi nd a solution to correct the offending problem? There is 
no one answer that fi ts all PQ-related solutions. Each type of PQ problem

requires its very own solution or treatment. There are many power treatment 
devices that refl ect different philosophies advocated by varying PQ profes-
sionals. To the user the wide variety of what is available on the market for 
resolving PQ problems can be confusing and frustrating. However, there are 
some basic considerations in selecting and applying PQ solutions that all 
agree upon. First, is there a single problem or multiple problems, and is the 
nature of the problem(s) understood so an informed solution can be imple-
mented; second any solution or treatment device installed has to obey the 
laws of physics and must be implemented without adversely affecting the 
loads; third the installation of the treatment device must be done correctly 
because if improperly installed, it may be detrimental to the system opera-
tion as was the original problem; and last the treatment device must be com-
patible with the load otherwise it may interact with the load causing a 
condition that is actually worse than before. The solutions and power treat-
ment devices for solving PQ problems can be classifi ed into three problem 
categories:
 
1. Voltage disturbances and noise
 
2. HDs
 
3. Wiring and grounding
Treatment devices are applied to modify a given electrical power to improve 
its quality and reliability for correct functioning of its loads. They can 
 perform a range of functions such as voltage regulation, noise elimination, 
and standby power supply (SPS), among others. Many different types of 
mitigating devices are available, but specifi cation and selection of mitigat-
ing equipment is dependent upon two considerations. First, the type of load 
to be powered must be considered. Single loads are effectively regulated 
with the proper mitigating device. However, larger systems that support 
many loads are far more complex. Requirements of all loads require consid-
eration, as well as the potential interaction between them to determine the 
proper mitigating devices required. Second, the equipment requirements 
for each application must be considered. Examples of such requirements 
include PQ requirements of the load, problems (improper wiring and 
grounding, temperature, humidity, ESD, etc.) which could interfere with 
proper operation of the critical load, type of conditioning required, future 
quality and reliability of the power supply, and cost to eliminate or mitigate 
power-related problems. The most commonly used mitigating devices and 
their characteristics for the three categories identifi ed above are discussed 
as follows:
12.7.1 Voltage Disturbances and Noise
The voltage disturbance, such as impulses, transients, swells, voltage dips, 
and interruptions were discussed in Section 12.2. The treatment devices for 
mitigating voltage disturbances and noise may be grouped as follows:

12.7.1.1 Noise Filters (Electronic Filters)
Noise fi lters prevent interference (e.g., conducted EMI and/or RFI) from trav-
eling into sensitive electronic equipment from the power source. These fi lters 
also prevent equipment that generates interference from feeding it back into 
the power line. Most sensitive electronic equipment utilize some type of 
noise fi lter. A basic noise fi lter is low pass LC fi lter, that is it passes line fre-
quency (60 Hz) and blocks the very high frequencies or steep wave front 
transients (Figure 12.33). This is accomplished by series inductors followed 
by capacitors to ground. The inductor forms two impedance paths: one low 
for the 60 Hz power and one high for the high-frequency noise. 
The remaining high-frequency noise is conducted by the capacitor to ground 
before it reaches the load. Many line fi lters are based on surge suppression 
components, such as surge suppressors but also have components that pro-
vide frequency response and waveform tracking. Waveform tracking allows 
the fi lter to clamp impulses at lower voltages than TVSS. The line fi lters exert 
more control over normal mode events compared to CM event because of 
absence of ground isolation capabilities. The line fi lters are listed under UL 
1012, Standard for Safety of Power Supplies.
12.7.1.2 TVSS
TVSS protect against voltage spikes and oscillatory-transient voltages. They 
are either gap type or the clamping type. The gap type is relatively slow 
acting (microseconds) with large energy handling ability. The clamping type

is fast acting (nanoseconds) with somewhat smaller energy-handling ability. 
The gap type units are best used near the power source entrance where as 
clamping type units are used near the equipment being protected.
The four basic types of equipment used for protection from transients are 
crowbar devices, voltage-clamping devices, attenuation (fi ltering) devices, 
and hybrid devices. The crowbar devices include air gaps, gas discharge 
tubes, lightning arrestors, and switching devices. The voltage-clamping 
devices consist of varistors (nonlinear resistors), MOVs, zener diodes, and 
selenium rectifi ers. These devices are unidirectional conductors until a 
breakdown voltage is reached, at which time they conduct in the reverse 
direction. Attenuation devices are inserted in a circuit to permit power at 
line frequency to pass, while attenuating transients. They are referred to as 
noise fi lters or low-pass fi lters. The attenuating devices are not truly sup-
pression devices, but have applications when noise or transients at particu-
lar frequencies are found on a specifi c power or data line. Hybrid devices are 
transient suppressors that combine two or more technologies to provide 
transient suppression over a wide range of voltages, rates of rise, and energy 
content. Protecting computers and sensitive electronic equipment against 
transients is a good installation practice. Careful grounding is necessary for 
these devices to be effective. Power to computers also should be separated 
electrically as much as possible from the remainder of building power 
system. Incoming power lines, data and communications lines entering from 
outside the building, and those inside the building subjected to transients 
should have transient protection. Separate protection for individual units 
may be needed (unless already built into the equipment) for computers and 
sensitive electronic equipment. In selecting the transient suppression devices, 
careful consideration should be given to the voltage rating of the devices. 
The devices selected should have a minimum voltage rating that is higher 
than the system or data line voltage or phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground 
voltage. Selecting the energy dissipation rating required is somewhat more 
diffi cult since it is rarely possible to predict the energy content of the tran-
sient that might occur. The device selected must survive the worst possible 
transient and, at the same time, the clamping voltage must not exceed the 
withstand voltage rating of the equipment being protected. Transient 
devices should be installed using the shortest possible conductors, so that 
its inductive reactance is small at high transient  frequencies. UL standard 
for safety, 1449 provides criteria for safety and performance testing of 
TVSS. TVSS tested and approved in accordance with this standard list the 
approval marking and maximum suppression voltage of the device.
12.7.1.3 Voltage Regulators
There are two types of voltage regulators that are available for maintaining 
correct voltage to the load. They are line voltage regulator and constant volt-
age regulator. The line voltage regulators maintain a relatively constant  voltage 
output within a specifi ed range, regardless of input voltage variations. 

810 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Although DC line voltage regulators are built into most sensitive electronic 
equipment, AC regulators are only now being built into some equipment. 
These regulators use the same ground reference on output as for the incom-
ing power. They can only modify input line voltage amplitude and cannot 
establish a new signal. Solid-state devices (e.g., constant voltage and 
 tap-changing transformers) are being used almost exclusively, rather than 
electromechanical types.
Line voltage regulators typically are used to protect against momentary 
and transient disturbances within a certain range. These regulators have 
a typical response time of 1 cycle. While many voltage problems can be 
handled by the appropriate application of a line voltage regulator, it is not 
suitable to protect sensitive electronic loads against rapid changes in volt-
age. They also do not have noise suppression capabilities. Regulators 
with switching power supplies actually create noise, and therefore are 
unsuitable for critical loads. The regulators also can become unstable if 
other regulators with similar response times are on the same circuit. Two 
types of line voltage regulators currently are available: tap changers and 
buck–boost.
The tap changers, also known as tap switchers or electronic tap switch-
ing transformers, regulate output voltage in response to fl uctuations in 
input voltage or load (see Figure 12.34). This is accomplished with solid-
state switches (SCRs or triacs) which automatically select appropriate taps 
on a power transformer (either isolating type or autotransformer type) at 
the zero current point of the output wave. Some of these devices are volt-
age switching type units that make the tap change at the voltage zero 
crossing. This causes a transient to be generated except when the load is at 
unity PF. The magnitude of this transient is determined by actual load 
conditions.
The buck–boost regulators assure smooth continuous output by regulating 
heavy inrush currents typically delivered by computer start-ups or disk drive 
motors. When power is fed into these regulators, they either add to (boosts)

or subtract from (bucks) the incoming voltage. These electronic devices elim-
inate use of steps as compared to the tap changer. Output is maintained 
 constant for 15%–20% variations of input voltage. This is accomplished by 
comparing output voltage to the desired (set) level and by the use of feedback 
to modify the level of boost or buck. A path for nonlinear currents generated 
by the load and by the regulator itself is provided by a parametric fi lter. 
An advantage of buck–boost regulators is that they attenuate normal mode 
noise and surges. In addition, if they are built with isolation and shielding, 
the regulators can be separately derived source for power grounding, and 
can provide CM noise reduction.
The constant voltage regulator is typically referred to as ferroresonant 
regulators or constant voltage transformers (CVTs). This type of regulator is 
a relatively simple device because it has no moving or active electronic parts. 
It uses a saturating transformer with a resonant circuit made up of the trans-
former’s inductance and a capacitor (Figure 12.35). The unit maintains a 
nearly constant voltage on the output for input swings of 20%–40%.
CVTs are susceptible to load imbalances and can become unstable. If the 
load current gets too high, these transformers tend to go out of resonance. 
They often can only supply 125%–200% of their full load rating. As a result, 
the CVTs cannot support starting current of motors exceeding these limits 
without a drastic dip in output voltage. CVTs are very ineffi cient at light 
loads and less effi cient at all other load levels. Their poor effi ciency is due to 
the resonant circuit which handles relatively large amounts of current all the 
time. As a result, the circuit causes the heat loss to be higher than other types 
of regulators. Noise can be a problem with these transformers requiring spe-
cial enclosures. Because of its saturating elements, the CVT is a nonlinear 
device and introduces harmonic currents on the power source supplying it. 
The constant voltage regulators should be oversized in order to provide 
for heavy starting or in-rush currents. This is because output voltage is sig-
nifi cantly reduced when these regulators are near their current limits.

The possibility also exists that the output voltage may not be compatible with 
some loads. In some cases, this can shut down other devices as a result of low 
output voltage of the CVT.
12.7.1.4 Isolation Transformers
Isolation transformers incorporate separate primary (or input) and second-
ary (or output) windings with electrostatic Faraday shielding around the 
windings. They perform two distinct functions. First, they transform or 
change the input to secondary output voltage level and/or to compensate for 
high or low voltage. Second, the transformers establish the power ground 
reference close to the point of use. Because of this, CM noise induced through 
ground loops or multiple current paths in the ground circuit upstream of 
the established reference ground point is signifi cantly reduced.
Isolation transformers introduce minimal magnetizing current distor-
tion into the input source. The delta-connected primary winding of the 
transformer can reduce the balanced third harmonic currents fed back to 
the source by single-phase nonlinear loads which are supplied from three-
phase feeder systems. When a delta primary, wye secondary, isolation 
transformer is used to power a load such as a single-phase rectifi er, the 
balanced third harmonic currents circulate in the delta primary so they 
are not seen by the power source. An isolation transformer may be designed 
with a simple electrostatic (Faraday) shield between the two sets of wind-
ings or they can be equipped with multi shields. Figure 12.36 shows an 
isolation transformer with three electrostatic Faraday shields, where pri-
mary and secondary winding are individually shield with an overall 
shield system. A single shield is normally adequate in most applications 
however additional shields increase the CM rejection capabilities of the 
transformer. This Faraday electrostatic shield comprises of conducting 
sheets of nonmagnetic material (copper or aluminum) connected to 
ground. They are designed to improve the isolation characteristics of the 
transformer. Electrostatic shielding adds little to the cost, size, and weight 
of the transformer. Isolation transformers can achieve effi ciencies from 
95% to 98%. These transformers generate little heat and are relatively quiet. 
They can be installed separately or with PDUs. Isolation transformers with 
distribution units have the advantage of being able to be located very close 
to the critical load.
12.7.1.5 Power Conditioners
Power line conditioners consist of one or more basic power treatment 
devices as previously discussed in this section. Some power conditioners 
may provide impulse attenuation, high-frequency fi ltering, isolation and 
voltage regulation others may not provide these features. Some of the power 
conditioners are: enhanced isolation transformer, ferroresonant power 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance

 conditioner, tap switching power conditioner, magnetic synthesizer, and 
motor generator (M-G) sets. These conditioners also provide a locally 
derived source with isolation while providing voltage regulation. Some 
advanced conditioners contain noise reduction features of isolation trans-
formers, fi ltering devices with voltage regulators, or surge suppressors to 
clamp high voltage surges.
The enhanced isolation transformer uses MOVs and air core wound chokes 
on the primary and a large capacitor across the secondary. These transform-
ers were designed primarily for modern SMPS. The impedance of the 
 transformer is kept low to ensure capability with the high inrush current of 
the power supply. The enhanced isolation transformers are available with 
single or multiple shields for improved CM noise attenuation.
The ferroresonant power conditioner is an isolation transformer operating 
in a saturated mode which was discussed in Section 12.7.1.3. It operates like 
a ferroresonant regulator with capability to regulate voltage and to a degree 
Leakage capacitance

perform waveshaping. Also, shielding between the primary and secondary 
improves the high frequency attenuations capabilities.
The tap switching power conditioner is an isolation transformer with mul-
tiple taps for voltage correction. However, some tap switching power condi-
tioners do not use isolation transformers, but instead use autotransformer. 
This power conditioner has the capability to regulate voltage, provide impulse 
attenuation and fi ltering.
The magnetic synthesizers consist of nonlinear inductors and capacitors 
in a parallel resonant circuit with six saturating pulse transformers. These 
synthesizers draw power from the source and generate their output voltage 
waveform by combining the pulses of the saturating transformers in a step 
wave manner. They provide noise and surge rejection and regulation of 
output voltage to within 10% over large swings (50%) input voltage. These 
units generally include additional fi ltering to eliminate self-induced 
 harmonics and pulse transformer shielding to attenuate CM disturbances. 
The magnetic synthesizer inherently limits maximum current at full voltage 
to 125%–200% of the rating. With greater loads, voltage drops off rapidly, 
producing  typically 200%–300% current at short circuit. Large step load 
changes, even within the unit’s rating, can cause signifi cant voltage and 
frequency transients in the output of this conditioner. These regulators 
work best when the load does not make large step changes. Due to the mag-
netics involved, these synthesizers tend to be large and heavy. They also 
can be acoustically noisy without special packaging. Some of the larger 
units display good effi ciencies, as long as they are operated at close to full 
load. The magnetic synthesizer introduces current distortion on its input, 
due to its nonlinear elements, which is at its highest when the conditioner 
is lightly loaded.
The M-Gs transform AC electrical power to mechanical power, then back 
to AC electrical power. They consist of an AC powered electric motor driv-
ing an AC generator, which then supplies AC power to the load as shown 
in Figure 12.37. Two types of M-Gs are utilized today. These are shaft or belt 
isolated M-Gs and rotating transformer M-Gs. In the former, the motor and 
generator are coupled by a shaft or belts. The latter units have a common 
rotor, a motor stator, and a generator stator. They generally are small units 
and have excellent effi ciency values. One disadvantage is that they do not 
provide the same level of noise and surge isolation between the input and 
the output as conventional M-Gs. Because of the coupling between the two 
stators (which are wound one on top of the other), the noise has a path 
through the unit. Shaft or belt isolated M-Gs are used widely as a source of 
415 Hz power for large computers requiring this frequency. They can be 
easily powered by a single 60 Hz induction motor. As the induction motor 
speed varies, the output frequency varies with motor speed since the gen-
erator output is a function of its shaft speed. However, the output voltage 
is maintained by controlling the excitation of the fi eld winding of the 
generator and the generator output voltage is independent of small motor 
speed changes.

12.7.1.6 UPS
An UPS conditions incoming power and provides continuous power in the 
event of a power failure (Figure 12.38). UPS typically contain batteries that 
can be used during power interruptions. They are either online or off-line 
and are available in a wide range of confi gurations, from battery backup to 
units backed by a standby generator that can supply power for days. Two 
types of UPS systems predominately used are static and rotary UPS 
(RUPS).
Static UPS systems: A majority of UPS systems used today are static. They 
are preferred over rotary systems because of lower cost, higher effi ciency,

ease of maintenance, and fewer moving parts. Static UPS systems instantly 
 provide power from battery to the load in the event of a power failure. 
Batteries used for large installations usually are lead-acid wet cells. Some 
smaller units use gelled-electrolyte cell or immobilized-electrolyte cell (main-
tenance free) batteries. Cost is infl uenced considerably by the length of 
battery protection time required and load size. In most instances, 15 min of 
protective time is considered adequate because it permits an orderly shut-
down of the load equipment. In many instances, however, the UPS system is 
used in conjunction with an engine-generator set. As such, the UPS provides 
instantaneous power until such time as load can be transferred to the engine-
generator set. In the event of an inverter failure or while maintenance is being 
performed on the UPS, a bypass transfer switch is included to allow connec-
tion of the utility to the critical load. This load can be transferred without 
interruption because UPS output is kept in phase with the utility source 
under normal operation. Static UPS systems can be either fl oat-type (online) 
or AC-input type.
The RUPS systems can be confi gured in several different ways. In one 
 confi guration, shown in Figure 12.39, the rectifi er of a RUPS is supplied 
from the utility source while the battery fl oats online. The inverter’s output 
 frequency is slaved to the utility source and follows it exactly. The solid-
state rectifi er supplies DC to the inverter and also maintains the battery at 
appropriate fl oat charge. The step function square wave AC output is used 
to drive the motor which, in turn, powers the generator. The M-G’s output 
frequency is maintained at 60 Hz. When the incoming power is interrupted, 
the high-capacity batteries supply DC to the inverter which, in turn, sup-
plies power to the M-G set. The inverter frequency control system main-
tains motor frequency within ±0.1% of rated 60 Hz while the batteries 
supply the load.

Also, the UPS can be confi gured as SPS systems to provide energy that can be 
used during power interruptions. SPSs typically comprise of batteries and are 
either off-line or stand-by type. Two categories of SPSs that are used to supply 
backup power are rotary and static SPS systems. These systems are designed as 
standby systems such that during normal operation the power is supplied via 
the bypass circuit to the loads. If a power interruption occurs, the SPS switches 
to the battery to supply power to the inverter, which in turn supplies the load.
12.7.2 HDs
The effects of HD on power equipment and circuits were discussed in Section 
12.5. High levels of stress due to HD can lead to problems for the utility’s 
 distribution system, plant distribution system and any power equipment 
 serviced by that distribution system. Effects can range from spurious  operation 
of equipment to a shutdown, such as machines or assembly lines, or cata-
strophic failure of equipment. Harmonics can lead to power system  ineffi ciency 
as well because increase in HD will decrease true PF. Some of the negative 
ways that harmonics affect plant equipment are summarized below:
Conductor overheating: Conductor heating is a function of the square of the 
rms current per unit volume in the conductor. Harmonic currents on under-
sized conductors or cables can cause a skin effect, which increases with 
frequency.
Capacitors: Capacitors are affected by heat increases due to power loss (tem-
perature rise) which will shorten life of capacitors. If a capacitor is tuned to 
one of the characteristic harmonics such as the fi fth or seventh, overvoltages 
due to resonance can cause dielectric failure or rupture of capacitor.
Fuses and circuit breakers: Harmonics can cause false or spurious operations 
of relays, breakers and protective trips, damaging or blowing components.
Transformers: Transformers have increased iron and copper losses or eddy cur-
rents due to stray fl ux losses. This causes overheating of transformer windings 
and iron (core).
Generators: Generators experience similar problems as transformers. Sizing 
and coordination is critical to the operation of the voltage regulator and con-
trols. Excessive harmonic voltage distortion will cause multiple zero cross-
ings of the current waveform. Multiple zero crossings affect the timing of the 
voltage regulator, causing interference and operation instability.
Revenue meters: Revenue meters may record measurements incorrectly, 
resulting in higher billings to user.
Drives/power supplies: VFDs and power supplies can be affected by misop-
eration due to multiple zero crossings. Harmonics can cause failure of the 
commutation circuits, found in DC drives and AC drives with SCRs.
Computers/telephones: These devices may experience interference or failure.

12.7.2.1 Industry Standards on Limits of Harmonics
The most often quoted standard on harmonics in the United States is IEEE 
519-1992, “Recommended practices and requirements for harmonic control 
in electric power systems.” The IEEE 519-1992 attempts to establish reason-
able harmonic goals for electrical systems that contain nonlinear (harmonic 
producing) loads. The objective is to propose steady state harmonic limits 
that are considered reasonable by both electric utilities and their customers. 
The underlying philosophy is that
Customers should limit harmonic currents
• 
Electric utilities should limit harmonic voltages
• 
Both parties share the responsibility for holding harmonic levels in 
• 
check
IEEE 519 applies to all voltage levels, including 120 V single-phase residential 
service, industrial and commercial entities, and utilities as well. While it 
does not specifi cally state the highest-order harmonic to limit, the generally 
accepted range of application is through the 50th harmonic for the industrial 
and commercial facilities. DC, which is not a harmonic, is also addressed 
and is prohibited. Since no differentiation is made between single-phase and 
three-phase systems, the recommended limits apply to both. It is important 
to remember that IEEE 519-1992 is a recommended practice and not an actual 
standard or legal document unless it is adopted by the local jurisdiction. 
Rather, it is intended to provide a reasonable framework within which engi-
neers can address and control harmonic problems. It has been adopted by 
many electric utilities and by several state public utility commissions, such 
as Texas and Oklahoma states.
According to the IEEE 519-1992 standard, the industrial and  commercial 
entity is responsible for controlling the harmonic currents created in their 
power systems. Since harmonic currents refl ected through distribution system 
impedances generate harmonic voltages on the utility distribution systems, the 
standard proposes guidelines based on industrial distribution system design. 
The Table 10.3 in IEEE 519-1992, defi nes levels of harmonic currents that indus-
trial and commercial customers can inject onto the utility distribution system. 
The contents of this table are shown in Table 12.18.
Table 11.1 of IEEE 519-1992 defi nes the voltage distortion limits that can be 
refl ected back onto the utility distribution system. Usually if the industrial or 
commercial user controls the overall combined current distortion according 
to Table 10.3 of IEEE 519, this should help the customers meet the limitations 
set forth in the guidelines of IEEE 519 standard (Table 12.19).
12.7.2.2 Evaluating System Harmonics
In order to prevent or correct harmonic problems within an industrial or com-
mercial facility an evaluation of system harmonics should be performed to 
quantify the problem. The harmonic evaluation can be conducted by either 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
819
performing an on-site measurement at the PCC, or by modeling the power 
system and performing a harmonic analysis study using a computer  simulation. 
The evaluation should determine total harmonic voltage and current distortion 
(THDV and THDI), and investigate the existence of harmonic resonance condi-
tions. The conditions listed below usually warrant a harmonic evaluation:
The application of capacitor banks in systems where 20% or more of 
• 
the load comprises of harmonic generating equipment
The facility has a history of harmonic-related problems, including 
• 
excessive capacitor fuse blowing
In facilities where power company has restrictive limits for harmonic 
• 
injection into their system than those recommended in the IEEE 519 
standard

12.7.2.3 Harmonic Solutions—Mitigation Devices and Methods
Harmonic solutions to solve harmonic problems may include using miti-
gation devices, such as current-limiting reactors, passive fi lters, active fi l-
ters, or other devices that minimize the fl ow of harmonic currents onto 
the utility’s distribution system and within the power system. Harmonic 
solution techniques fall into two broad categories, (1) preventive and (2) 
remedial.
Preventive measures: Preventive measures focus on minimizing the har-
monic currents that are injected into power systems. Preventive measures 
include the following:
Strict adherence to IEEE 519.
• 
Phase cancellation:
• 
 The use of 12-pulse converters instead of six-pulse 
converters. Most harmonic problems with converters (VFDs and the 
like) are associated with high fi fth and seventh harmonic currents, and 
if they are eliminated through phase cancellation, harmonic problems 
rarely develop. In situations where there are multiple six-pulse convert-
ers, serving half of them (in terms of power) through delta–delta or 
wye–wye transformers, and the other half through delta–wye or wye–
delta transformers, achieves net 12-pulse operation.

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
821
Use of low distorting loads: Because of IEEE 519, increasing attention 
• 
is being given to the current THD of distorting loads. For example, 
12-pulse (or higher) VFDs and low-distortion fl uorescent lamp ballasts 
can be used to lower current distortion.
Computer simulations: It is always better to simulate the impact of 
• 
a large distorting load before it is ordered and installed. Solutions 
can be proposed and evaluated on paper, and implemented when 
the load is installed.
Remedial measures: Remedial measures include the following:
Circuit detuning: By using only fi eld measurements, such as capacitor cur-
rent waveforms, it is possible to identify the capacitor banks that are most 
affected by resonance. As a temporary measure the affected capacitor bank 
can be switched off to see if the resonance problem subsides. Of course, the 
problem may simply transfer to another capacitor bank, so measurements 
after switching at other capacitor banks must be made to see if the temporary 
solution is satisfactory. If switching a capacitor bank off temporarily solves 
the problem, computer simulations may be in order to test fi ltering options 
and possible relocation of the capacitor bank.
Passive harmonic fi lters: These are widely used to control harmonics, espe-
cially the fi fth and seventh harmonics. Most fi lters consist of series L and C 
components that provide a single-tuned notch with a low-impedance ground 
path. At 50/60 Hz, these fi lters are, for all practical purposes, capacitors. Thus, 
passive fi lters provide both PF correction and voltage distortion control. Fifth 
harmonic fi ltering is usually adequate to solve most distribution system har-
monic problems. However, in some cases it may be necessary to add 7th, 11th, 
and 13th harmonic fi lters, in that order. In general, harmonics may not be 
skipped. For example, if the problem harmonic is the seventh, both fi fth and 
seventh harmonic fi lters must be added because the seventh fi lter alone would 
aggravate the fi fth harmonic voltage. Filters tuned near the third  harmonic 
must be avoided because transformers and machines located throughout dis-
tribution feeders are sources of third harmonics, and their currents will easily 
overwhelm third harmonic fi lters. Usually, the higher the harmonic, the 
fewer kVARs needed for a fi lter. For multiple fi lter installations, a good prac-
tice is to stairstep the kVAR as follows: if Q kVARs are used for the 5th har-
monic, then Q/2 should be used for the 7th, Q/4 for the 11th, and Q/8 for the 
13th. Of course, actual sizes must match standard kVAR sizes. For best per-
formance, a fi lter should be at least 300 kVAR (three-phase). It may be possible 
to add low-voltage fi lters without performing computer simulations, as long 
as all shunt capacitors in the facility are fi ltered. However, in a utility distri-
bution system, it is always prudent to perform computer simulations to make 
sure that a fi lter does not aggravate the harmonics situation at a remote point. 
This is especially true if the feeder also has unfi ltered capacitors.
Harmonic current fi lters prevent input harmonics of nonlinear electronic 
loads from being fed back into the power service. Nonfi ltered input  harmonics 

822 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
can generate heat which can have an effect on conductors and transformers 
and cause voltage distortion. The fi lters vary in size from small units for plug-
connected loads to larger devices for hard-wired loads. Different types of har-
monic current fi lters are illustrated in Figure 12.40. Harmonic current fi lters 
typically are placed in parallel with the load. If installed and used properly, 
these fi lters work best at reducing harmonic currents at their source. They also 
eliminate the need for other changes to compensate for the problems caused 
by the harmonic currents.
Some problems associated with passive fi lters are that:
Their effectiveness diminishes over time as their capacitors age, 
• 
losing μF and thus raising their notch frequency.
They attract harmonic currents from all sources in the network—
• 
new, known, and unknown, so that they may become overloaded.
Active fi lters. This is a new and promising technology, but there are 
• 
as yet few distribution feeder installations. Active fi lters are power

The performance of mitigation equipment must be verifi ed by extensive mon-
itoring, both before and after commissioning. At least 2 days of recordings 
before commissioning, and one week after, should be made to assure that the 
mitigation equipment is performing as planned. One week of measurements 
is needed so that the entire weekly load cycle can be observed.
Monitoring should include time traces of voltage and current THD,  spectra, 
sample waveforms, power, and harmonic power.
Delta–delta and delta–wye transformers: This confi guration uses two separate 
utility feed transformers with equal nonlinear loads. This shifts the phase 
relationship to various six-pulse converters through cancellation techniques, 
similar to the 12-pulse confi guration.
Isolation transformers: An isolation transformer provides a good solution in 
many cases. The advantage is the potential to voltage match by stepping up 
or stepping down the system voltage, and by providing a N–G reference for 
nuisance ground faults. This is the best solution when utilizing AC or DC 
drives that use SCRs as bridge rectifi ers.
Line reactors: More commonly used for size and cost, the line reactor is the best 
solution for harmonic reduction when compared to an isolation transformer. 
AC drives that use diode bridge rectifi er front ends are best suited for line reac-
tors. Line reactors (commonly referred to as inductors) are available in standard 
impedance ranges from 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7.5%.
12.7.3 Wiring and Grounding Problems
In those facilities that are experiencing equipment problems that appear to 
be power-related, a on-site inspection will be required to verify that power 
disturbances are the cause of electronic equipment malfunction or failure. 
The specifi c objective of such an inspection is to determine condition and 
adequacy of the wiring and grounding system. This inspection should 
include the following checks:
Wiring and grounding: Wiring and grounding measurements detect prob-
lems in the feeders and branch circuits serving the critical load. The test 
instruments used to conduct these tests should be selected carefully. Use of 

824 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
commonly available three-light circuit testers is not recommended. These 
instruments have limitations and can provide a correct indication when 
the circuit being tested actually has one or more problems. They also are 
 incapable of indicating the integrity of power conductors. Recommended 
instruments for these measurements include true-rms multimeter, true-rms 
clamp-on multimeter, and ground impedance testers. These instruments are 
described in Section 12.6.
Continuity of conduit/enclosure grounds: Electronic equipment should be 
grounded with a separate equipment grounding conductor. This conductor can 
be terminated in an IG system, insulated from the conduit ground, or in the 
conduit ground system. This is because both are ultimately connected to the 
building ground systems. However, the IG and conduit ground must terminate 
at the fi rst upstream N–G bonding point. Ground impedance testers can be 
used to measure the quality of both the IG and conduit ground systems from 
the equipment to the power source. To achieve good performance from sensi-
tive electronic loads, phase, neutral, and equipment grounding conductors 
should be routed through continuously grounded metallic conduit. Continuously 
grounded metal conduit provides a shield for radiated interference.
Load phase and neutral currents: Measurements of load phase and neutral cur-
rents are necessary to determine whether the load is sharing a neutral conduc-
tor with other loads. They also determine whether the neutral conductor 
sizing is adequate. When sizing neutral conductors, one should keep in mind 
that the current in the neutral can exceed current in the phase conductor. This 
is because three-phase circuits supplying single-phase loads have nonlinear 
current characteristics and share a common neutral. A true-rms reading 
clamp-on ammeter must be used to make phase and neutral conductor mea-
surements. To determine whether the neutral serving the sensitive electronic 
load is shared with other loads, check the neutral current with the sensitive 
load turned off. If the current is not zero, a shared neutral is being used.
N–G bonds: The NEC requires bonding of the neutral and equipment 
grounding conductor at the main service panel (NEC 250-53) and the sec-
ondary side of SDSs (NEC 250-26(a) ). If not properly bonded, N–G bonds 
create shock hazards for operating personnel, and degrade the performance 
of sensitive electronic equipment. These bonds can be detected using a 
wiring and grounding tester. A voltage measurement between neutral and 
ground at the outlets may indicate voltage from millivolt to few volts range 
under normal operating conditions. A zero voltage indicates the presence of 
a nearby N–G bond. Excessive current on equipment grounds in distribution 
panels also indicates the possibility of a load side N–G bond.
Equipment grounding conductor impedance: The impedance of the equipment 
grounding conductor is measured using a ground impedance tester. Properly 
installed and maintained equipment ground conductors exhibit very low 
impedance levels. A high impedance measurement indicates poor quality 
connections in the equipment grounding system or an improperly installed 

Power Quality, Harmonics, and Predictive Maintenance  
825
equipment grounding conductor. An open ground measurement reveals no 
equipment grounding conductor connection. Recommended practice is to 
verify an impedance level of 0.25 Ω or less. This also helps assure personnel 
protection under fault conditions.
Neutral conductor impedance: Neutral conductor impedance is measured 
because a low impedance neutral is essential to minimize N–G potentials at 
the load and reduce CM noise. A ground impedance tester can be used to 
conduct these measurements. It is necessary for neutral conductors to have 
low impedance.
Grounding electrode resistance: The grounding electrode system provides an 
earth reference point for the facility and a path for lightning and static electricity. 
This is important because the electrode serves as the connection between the 
building grounding system and the grounding electrode system. An accurate 
measurement can be taken only when the grounding electrode is disconnected 
from all other grounds. For new construction, the resistance of the grounding 
electrode system is measured with an earth ground tester using the fall-of-po-
tential method. It is recommended that the measured resistance be in accordance 
with the design values and industry standards and codes. For more information 
on grounding and ground resistance measurements, refer to Chapter 11.
Current fl ow in the grounding electrode conductor can be measured using a 
clamp-on ammeter. In most cases, small current fl ow will exist. However, zero 
current fl ow usually indicates an open connection. Current fl ow on the order 
of the phase currents indicates serious problems or possible fault conditions.
IG and conduit ground systems: The quality of both the IG and conduit 
ground systems from the equipment to the ground source needs to be mea-
sured. This is to ensure that sensitive electronic loads are grounded with a 
separate equipment grounding conductor and are ultimately connected to 
the  building grounding system. Both ground systems terminate at the fi rst 
upstream N–G bonding point. The phase, neutral, and equipment ground-
ing conductors should be routed through continuously grounded metallic 
conduit. As a result, better performance of sensitive electronic equipment is 
achieved. Another benefi t is that safety codes are met.
Dedicated feeders and direct path routing: Measuring phase currents with the 
critical loads turned off is one way to determine if sensitive electronic loads 
are being served by dedicated branch feeders with conductor routing in as 
short and direct a path as possible. If there is any current fl ow, the feeder is 
being used to serve other loads.
SDSs: No direct electrical connection should exist between SDSs and output 
and input conductors. SDSs are required by the NEC to have a load-side N–G 
bond which is connected to the grounding electrode system. All equipment 
grounding conductors, any IG conductors, neutral conductors, and the metal 
enclosure of the SDSs are required to be bonded together and bonded to the 
grounding electrode conductor. Visual inspections and measurements with a 
ground impedance tester can determine the quality of these connections.

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, 
Switching Practices, 
and Precautions
13.1 Introduction
Safety in electrical systems concerns three different areas: protection of life, 
protection of property, and protection of uninterrupted productive output. 
The required investment to accomplish improved safety often consists 
merely of additional planning effort without any extra equipment invest-
ment. The protection of human life is paramount. Electrical plant property 
can be replaced and lost production can be made up, but human life can 
never be recovered nor human suffering compensated for. To achieve 
improved safety to personnel, special attention should be directed to ener-
gized equipment, adequate short-circuit protective devices, a good mainte-
nance program, simplicity of the electrical system design, and proper 
training of personnel who work around electricity. Many of the items neces-
sary to give improved protection to life will also secure improved protection 
to plant property and minimize breakdown of electrical system equipment. 
This chapter deals with electrical safety, switching practices, arc-fl ash hazard 
analysis, precautions, and accident prevention.
Most electrical companies and plants have safety programs and rules in 
the workplace and training programs for their employees. Most safety pro-
grams embody company safety rules and practices, national and local codes 
and standards, and federal and state laws. For individuals to carry out their 
duties, they must be knowledgeable of the rules and standards that apply to 
their workplace. Electrical safety standards and requirements are varied; 
some are voluntary while others are laws that are mandatory, and provide 
guidance for safely working around or on electrical energy. Since the stan-
dards are periodically revised, one should always refer to the most recent 
version of the standard when consulting such a standard. A brief discussion 
of the safety standards, arc-fl ash hazard analysis and labeling of equipment, 
and regulations related to these topics and electricity are covered below to 
familiarize the reader with them.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
13.2  Industry Standards and Regulatory 
Requirements for Safety
13.2.1 ANSI C2: The National Electrical Safety Code-2007
The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) is intended to provide practical 
rules for safeguarding personnel during the installation, operation, or main-
tenance of electrical supply and communications lines and associated equip-
ment. The NESC rules cover supply and communications lines, equipment, 
and associated work practices used by both private and public electrical 
companies (utilities). The NESC covers fi ve major areas as listed below.
Grounding methods for electrical supply and communications 
• 
facilities
Rules for installation and maintenance of electrical supply stations 
• 
and equipment
Safety rules for the installation and maintenance of overhead electrical 
• 
supply and communications lines
Safety rules for the installation and maintenance of underground 
• 
electric supply and communications lines
Rules for the operation of electric supply and communications lines 
• 
and equipment
Section 410, “General requirements” of NESC-2007 contains information and 
guidance on electric safety requirements that are necessary for safeguarding 
employees in the workplace. In accordance with Section 410 the employer is 
required to inform the employees on safety rules, safety training and arc 
hazard evaluation including wearing of arc-rated clothing. These require-
ments as stated in NESC-2007 standard are as follows:
 
1. The employer shall inform each employee working on or about 
communications equipment or electric supply equipment and the 
associated lines, of the safety rules governing the employee’s con-
duct while so engaged. When deemed necessary, the employer shall 
provide a copy of such rules.
 
2. The employer shall provide training to all employees who work in 
the vicinity of exposed energized facilities. The training shall include 
applicable work rules required by this part and other mandatory 
referenced standards or rules. The employer shall ensure that each 
employee has demonstrated profi ciency in required tasks. The 
employer shall provide retraining for any employee who, as a result 
of routine observance of work practices, is not following work rules.
 
3. Effective as of January 1, 2009, the employer shall ensure that an 
assessment is performed to determine potential exposure to an 

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  829
electric arc for employees who work on or near energized parts or 
equipment. If the assessment determines a potential employee 
exposure greater than 2 cal/cm2 exists, the employer shall require 
employees to wear clothing or a clothing system that has an effec-
tive arc rating not less than the anticipated level of arc energy. When 
exposed to an electric arc or fl ame, clothing made from the follow-
ing materials shall not be worn: acetate, nylon, polyester, or poly-
propylene. The effective arc rating of clothing or a clothing system 
to be worn at voltages 1000 V and above shall be determined using 
Tables 410-1 and 410-2 or performing an arc hazard analysis. When 
an arc hazard analysis is performed, it shall include a calculation 
of the estimated arc energy based on the available fault current, 
the duration of the arc (cycles), and the distance from the arc to the 
employee.
Exception 1: If the clothing required by this rule has the potential to create 
additional and greater hazards than the possible exposure to 
the heat energy of the electric arc, then clothing with an arc 
rating or arc thermal performance value (ATPV) less than that 
required by the rule can be worn.
Exception 2: For secondary systems below 1000 V, applicable work rules 
required by this part and engineering controls shall be uti-
lized to limit exposure. In lieu of performing an arc hazard 
analysis, clothing or a clothing system with a minimum effec-
tive arc rating of 4 cal/cm2 shall be required to limit the likeli-
hood of ignition.
Note 1: A clothing system (multiple layers) that includes an outer layer of 
fl ame-resistant (FR) material and an inner layer of non-FR material 
has been shown to block more heat than a single layer. The effect of 
the combination of these multiple layers can be referred to as the 
effective arc rating.
Note 2: It is recognized that arc energy levels can be excessive with second-
ary systems. Applicable work rules required by this part and engi-
neering controls should be utilized.
13.2.2  ANSI/National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70, 
National Electrical Code (NEC)-2008
The NEC NFPA 70 is part of the NFPA codes. The NEC includes information 
on design, installation and other technical information of electrical facilities 
and its principle objective is to help minimize the possibility of electric fi res. 
The NEC or portions of it are adopted as local law in many municipalities, 
cities, states, and other such areas. Since 2002, the NEC, article 110-16 requires 

830 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
fl ash hazard labels on electrical equipment to warn personnel of the potential 
electric arc-fl ash hazards and the personal protective equipment (PPE) they 
must wear when working on energized equipment. The NEC article 110-16 
is listed below for reader’s reference.
110.16—fl ash protection: Electrical equipment, such as switchboards, panel-
boards, industrial control panels, meter socket enclosures, and motor control 
centers, that are in other than dwelling occupancies, and are likely to require 
examination, adjustment, servicing, or maintenance while energized shall be 
fi eld marked to warn qualifi ed persons of potential electric arc-fl ash hazards. 
The marking shall be located so as to be clearly visible to qualifi ed persons 
before examination, adjustment, servicing, or maintenance of the equipment.
FPN No. 1: NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace-2004, 
provides assistance in determining severity of potential expo-
sure, planning safe work practices, and selecting PPE.
FPN No. 2: ANSI Z535.4-1998, Product Safety Signs and Labels, provides 
guidelines for the design of safety signs and labels for applica-
tion to products.
13.2.3  ANSI/NFPA 70B, Standard for Electrical Equipment 
Maintenance-2006
The electrical equipment maintenance is a publication of the NFPA and it 
contains recommended practice information on maintenance of electric 
equipment and apparatus. The 70B document covers systems and equipment 
which are typically installed in industrial plants, commercial buildings, and 
large family dwellings.
13.2.4  ANSI/NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety
in the Workplace-2004
The electrical safety requirement in workplaces is a publication of NFPA. 
This code contains information and guidance on electric safety requirements 
that are necessary for safeguarding employees in the workplace. The sixth 
edition, published in 2004, refl ects several signifi cant changes to the older 
versions of 70E. The major changes emphasize safe work practices. Clarity 
and usability of the document are also enhanced. The name of the document 
was changed to NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. The 
existing Parts 1 through 4 were renamed as Chapters 1 through 4 and are 
reorganized as follows:
Chapter 1 Safety-related work practices
Chapter 2 Safety-related maintenance requirements
Chapter 3 Safety requirements for special equipment
Chapter 4 Installation safety requirements

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  831
This standard is compatible with corresponding provisions of the NEC, 
but is not intended to, nor can it, be used in lieu of the NEC. Chapter 4 of 
NFPA 70E is intended to serve a very specifi c need of OSHA and is in no way 
intended to be used as a substitute for the NEC. NFPA 70E is intended for use 
by employers, employees, and OSHA.
The chapter on safety-related work practices was reorganized to empha-
size working on live parts as the last alternative work practice. Therefore it 
contains extensive requirements for working on or near electrical conductors 
or circuit parts that have not been put into an electrically safe work condition. 
When such work is to be performed, the required electrical hazard analysis 
has specifi c requirements for the analysis of shock and fl ash hazards. Other 
sections of the 70E provide guidance on selecting the proper PPE. The 
signifi cant requirements for the analysis of shock and fl ash hazards are 
as follows:
The NFPA 70E, Article 110.8 (B) (1) Electrical hazard analysis: If the live parts 
operating at 50 V or more are not placed in an electrically safe work condition, 
other  safety-related work practices shall be used to protect employees who 
might be exposed to the electrical hazards involved. Such work practices shall 
protect each employee from arc fl ash and from contact with live parts operating 
at 50 V or more directly with any part of the body or indirectly through some 
other conductive object. Work practices that are used shall be suitable for the 
conditions under which the work is to be performed and for the voltage level of 
the live parts. Appropriate safety-related work practices shall be determined 
before any person approaches exposed live parts within the limited approach 
boundary by using both shock hazard analysis and fl ash hazard analysis.
(a) Shock hazard analysis. A shock hazard analysis shall determine the volt-
age to which personnel will be exposed, boundary requirements, and the 
PPE necessary in order to minimize the possibility of electrical shock to 
personnel. (b) Flash hazard analysis. A fl ash hazard analysis shall be done in 
order to protect personnel from the possibility of being injured by an arc 
fl ash. The analysis shall determine the fl ash protection boundary and the 
PPE that people within the fl ash protection boundary shall use.
The NFPA 70E, Article 130.2 Approach boundaries to live parts:
 A. Shock hazard analysis: A shock hazard analysis shall determine the 
voltage to which personnel will be exposed, boundary requirements, 
and the PPE necessary in order to minimize the possibility of electric 
shock to personnel.
 
B. Shock protection boundaries: The shock protection boundaries identi-
fi ed as limited, restricted, and prohibited approach boundaries are 
applicable to the situation in which approaching personnel are 
exposed to live parts.
 
C. Approach to exposed live parts operating at 50 V or more: No qualifi ed 
person shall approach or take any conductive object closer to 

832 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
exposed live parts operating at 50 V or more than the restricted 
approach boundary set forth in Table 130.2(C), unless any of the 
following apply:
 
1. The qualifi ed person is insulated or guarded from the live parts 
operating at 50 V or more (insulating gloves or insulating gloves 
and sleeves are considered insulation only with regard to the ener-
gized parts upon which work is being performed), and no part of 
the qualifi ed person’s body crosses the prohibited approach 
boundary set forth in Table 130.2(C) which is shown in Table 13.1.
 
2. The live part operating at 50 V or more is insulated from the 
qualifi ed person and from any other conductive object at a 
different potential.
 
3. The qualifi ed person is insulated from any other conductive 
object as during live-line bare-hand work.
 
D. Approach by unqualifi ed persons: Unqualifi ed persons shall not be 
permitted to enter spaces that are required under 400.16(A) to 
be accessible to qualifi ed employees only, unless the electric con-
ductors and equipment involved are in an electrically safe work 
condition.
 
1. Working at or close to the limited approach boundary: Where one or 
more unqualifi ed persons are working at or close to the limited 
approach boundary, the designated person in charge of the work 
space where the electrical hazard exists shall cooperate with the des-
ignated person in charge of the unqualifi ed person(s) to ensure that 
all work can be done safely. This shall include advising the unquali-
fi ed person(s) of the electrical hazard and warning him or her to stay 
outside of the Limited Approach Boundary.
 
2. Entering the limited approach boundary: Where there is a need for an 
unqualifi ed person(s) to cross the limited approach boundary, a quali-
fi ed person shall advise him or her of the possible hazards and continu-
ously escort the unqualifi ed person(s) while inside the limited approach 
boundary. Under no circumstance shall the escorted unqualifi ed 
person(s) be permitted to cross the restricted approach boundary.
The requirements stated in NFPA 70E for shock protection and safe 
distances for qualifi ed and unqualifi ed personnel can be summa-
rized as follows:
Flash protection boundary: An approach limit at a distance from exposed 
live parts within which a person could receive a second-degree burn 
if an electric arc fl ash were to occur. Appropriate fl ash-fl ame protec-
tion equipment must be utilized for persons entering the fl ash pro-
tection region. This distance may be outside or inside the following 
shock protection distances.

Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Limited approach boundary: An approach limit at a distance from an 
exposed live part within which a shock hazard exists. A person 
crossing the limited approach boundary and entering the limited 
region must be qualifi ed to perform the job/task.
Restricted approach boundary: An approach limit at a distance from an 
exposed live part within which there is an increased risk of shock, 
due to electrical arc over combined with inadvertent movement, for 
personnel working in close proximity to the live part. The person 
crossing the restricted approach boundary and entering the restricted 
space must have a documented work plan approved by authorized 
management, use PPE that is appropriate for the work being per-
formed and is rated for voltage and energy level involved.
Prohibited approach boundary: An approach limit at a distance from an 
exposed live part within which work is considered the same as 
making  contact with the live part. The person entering the prohib-
ited space must have specifi ed training to work on energized con-
ductors or live parts. Any tools used in the prohibited space must be 
rated for direct contact at the voltage and energy level involved. The 
limits of approach are depicted in Figure 13.1.

determine the fl ash protection boundary and the PPE that people 
within the fl ash  protection boundary shall use.
Flash protection boundary: For systems that are 600 V or less, the fl ash 
protection boundary shall be 4.0 ft, based on the product of clearing 
times of six cycles (0.1 s) and the available bolted fault current of 
50 kA or any combination not exceeding 300 kA cycles (5000 A s). For 
clearing times and bolted fault currents other than 300 kA cycles, or 
under engineering supervision, the fl ash protection boundary shall 
alternatively be permitted to be calculated in accordance with the 
following general formula:

MVA is the capacity rating of transformer (mega volt-amps). For 
transformers with MVA ratings below 0.75 MVA, multiply the 
transformer MVA rating by 1.25
t is the time of arc exposure (s)
At voltage levels above 600 V, the fl ash protection boundary is the distance at 
which the incident energy equals 5 J/cm2(1.2 cal/cm2). For situations where 
fault clearing time is 0.1 s (or faster), the fl ash protection boundary is the 
distance at which the incident energy level equals 6.24 J/cm2(1.5 cal/cm2).
Protective clothing and PPE for application with a fl ash hazard analysis: Where 
it has been determined that work will be performed within the fl ash 
protection boundary by NFPA 70E, Article 130.3(A), the fl ash hazard 
analysis shall determine, and the employer shall document, the inci-
dent energy exposure of the worker (cal/cm2). The incident energy 
exposure level shall be based on the working distance of the employ-
ee’s face and chest areas from a prospective arc source for the specifi c 
task to be performed. FR clothing and PPE shall be used by the 
employee based on the incident energy exposure associated with the 
specifi c task. Recognizing that incident energy increases as the dis-
tance from the arc fl ash decreases, additional PPE shall be used for any 
parts of the body that are closer than the distance at which the incident 
energy was determined. As an alternative, the PPE requirements of 
NFPA  70E, Article 130.7(C)(9)(a) shall be permitted to be used in lieu 
of the detailed fl ash hazard analysis approach described in NFPA 70E, 
Article 130.3(A).
The NFPA 70E, Article 130.7 (13), Arc fl ash protective equipment: All 
 arc-rated PPE include the ATPV with units in cal/cm2. The required 

836 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
PPE at specifi c locations is determined by comparing the calculated 
 incident energy to the ratings for specifi c combinations of PPE. NFPA 
70E, Table 130.7(C)(11) lists examples of protective clothing systems 
and typical characteristics including the degree of protection for 
various clothing. The protective clothing selected for the correspond-
ing hazard/risk category number shall have an arc rating of at least 
the value listed in the last column of NFPA 70E, Table 130.7(C)(11). 
The NFPA 70E, Table 130.7(C)(11) is shown in Table 13.2 below.
For actual applications, the calculated incident energy must be com-
pared to specifi c PPE combinations used at the facility being evalu-
ated. The exception to this is the upper limit of 40 cal/cm2. While PPE 
is available in ATPV values of 100 cal/cm2 or more, values above 
40 cal/cm2 are prohibited due to the sound, pressure, and concussive 
forces. The sound, pressure, and concussive forces are more severe 
than the thermal values of arc energy greater than 40 cal/cm2. An 
examination of the categories listed in Table 13.2 implies that each 
category has range (spread) of arc rating, i.e., for example category 1 
range is 4–7.999, category 2 range is 8–24.999, and so on. It should be 
noted that manufacturers are allowed to label their garments for a given 
PPE category as long as garment’s thermal value falls within the cat-
egory’s range. For example, a garment with an 8 cal/cm2 rating can be 
labeled category 2 even though the category 2 can go up to 24.99 cal.

Note: Arc rating is defi ned in Article 100 and can be either ATPV or EBT. ATPV is defi ned in 
ASTM F 1959-99 as the incident energy on a fabric or material that results in suffi cient heat 
transfer through the fabric or material to cause the onset of a second-degree burn based on 
the Stoll curve. EBT is defi ned in ASTM F 1959-99 as the average of the fi ve highest incident 
energy exposure values below the Stoll curve where the specimens do not exhibit break 
open. EBT is reported when ATPV cannot be measured due to FR fabric break open.

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  837
It is inappropriate for some manufacturers to promote their safety 
equipment using lower calorie values for a given category of PPE. 
Therefore, when selecting PPE, the actual calculated incident energy 
at the specifi c work location must be compared to specifi c garment 
thermal rating within the given category to correctly protect the 
worker from a fl ash hazard.
The NFPA 70E, Article  400.11, Flash Protection: Switchboards, panelboards, 
industrial control panels, and motor control centers in other than dwell-
ing occupancies and are likely to require examination, adjustment, ser-
vicing, or maintenance while energized shall be fi eld marked to warn 
qualifi ed persons of potential electric arc-fl ash hazards. The marking 
shall be located so as to be clearly visible to qualifi ed persons before 
examination, adjustment, servicing, or maintenance of the equipment. 
This is the same requirement stated in Article 110-16 of the NEC-2002.
13.2.5  Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) Standards
OSHA standards are federal regulations and apply to all covered industries 
except those states which have adopted safety programs which are approved 
by the OSHA. A partial listing of industries covered by OSHA is General 
Industry, Construction Industry, Power Generation, Transmission and 
Distribution, and Telecommunications. OSHA safety standards are published 
in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Subtitle B, Chapter XVII. The 
OSHA electrical safety standards are in at least four categories similar to the 
four chapters of NFPA 70E.
These are
Design and installation safety
• 
Safety-related work practices
• 
Safety-related maintenance requirements
• 
Special equipment
• 
Electrical safety standards for general industry are found in Part 1910, 
Subpart S, I, and J. A partial listing of subpart S and I is given below.

838 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
them, unless the employer can demonstrate that de-energizing introduces 
additional or increased hazards or is infeasible due to design or operational 
limitations. When employees are required to work where there is a potential 
electrical hazard, part 1910.335 calls for the employer to provide electrical pro-
tective equipment that is appropriate for the specifi c parts of the body to be 
protected and for the work to be performed.
Employers are responsible for performing a hazard assessment in accor-
dance with part 1910.132(d)(1) (i–iii). The requirements are as follows:
1910.132(d)(1): The employer shall assess the workplace to determine if 
 hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the 
use of PPE. If such hazards are present, likely to be present, the employer 
shall:
1910.132(d)(1)(i): Select, and have each affected employee use, the types 
of PPE that will protect the affected employee from the hazards 
identifi ed in the hazard assessment
1910.132(d)(1)(ii): Communicate selection decisions to each affected 
employee
1910.132(d)(1)(iii): Select PPE that properly fi ts each affected employee.
The employer shall verify that the required workplace hazard assess-
ment has been performed through a written certifi cation that iden-
tifi es the  workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the 
evaluation has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assess-
ment; and, which identifi es the document as a certifi cation of hazard 
assessment.
1910.335(a)(1)(i) PPE: Employees working in areas where there are 
potential electrical hazards shall be provided with, and shall use, elec-
trical protective equipment that is appropriate for the specifi c parts of 
the body to be protected and for the work to be performed.
1910.132(f) Training: The employer shall provide training to each 
employee who is required by this section to use PPE. Each such 
employee shall be trained to know at least the following: (1) When 
PPE is necessary; (2) What PPE is necessary; (3) How to properly don, 
doff, adjust, and wear PPE; (4) The limitations of the PPE; and (5) The 
proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE.
Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the 
training specifi ed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and the ability to 
use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring 
the use of PPE.
1910.132(f)(3) Profi ciency and Retraining: When the employer has reason 
to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained, 
but does not have the understanding and skill required by para-
graph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such 
employee. Circumstances where retraining is required include, but 
are not limited to, situations where: changes in the workplace render 

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  839
previous training obsolete; or changes in the types of PPE to be used 
render previous training obsolete; or inadequacies in an affected 
employee’s knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the 
employee has not retained the requisite understanding or skill. 
The employer shall verify that each affected employee has received 
and understood the required training through a written certifi cation 
that contains the name of each employee trained, the date(s) of train-
ing, and that identifi es the subject of the certifi cation.
13.3 Arc-Flash Hazard and Regulatory Requirements
The regulatory requirements of OSHA, NFPA 70, and NFPA 70E pertaining 
to a worker’s safety are described in Section 13.2. The regulatory requirements 
can be summarized as follows:
 
1. Determine the risk to personnel from exposure to incident energy 
released during an arc-fl ash event, i.e., the arc-fl ash hazard must be 
quantifi ed.
 
2. Provide appropriate arc-fl ash hazard protection, i.e., correct PPE 
must be selected for nonprohibited work.
 
3. The arc fl ash assessment results must be documented and equipment 
labeled to inform and warn personnel of arc-fl ash hazard.
 
4. Personnel must be trained, understand the extent of arc-fl ash hazard, 
and take correct protective actions.
To quantify the hazard for each specifi c location, arc-fl ash analysis should be 
performed using either the IEEE 1584, IEEE Guide for Performing Arc-Flash 
Hazard Calculations, methodology or the alternate method given in 70E. The 
IEEE 1584 and 70E methodologies involve calculating available short-circuit 
currents for each location, determining the clearing time of protective relays 
and devices, equipment location type and working distance. See Sections 
13.3.2 and 13.3.3 for more details on performing the arc-fl ash analysis study. 
The correct PPE category is selected based on the results of the arc-fl ash 
hazard analysis study. After completion of the steps 1 and 2, correct labeling 
is developed to label the equipment in accordance with NEC and 70E require-
ments to warn personnel of the hazard. The labels that are generated from the 
arc-fl ash analysis programs are color coded to signify the severity of the 
danger of the incident energy available at the particular  location. For exam-
ple, the label color codes range from color green for category 0 (minimum 
severity) to color red (maximum severity) for which no PPE category is avail-
able and where no work can be done on energized equipment. A sample of 
the two labels generated using an arc-fl ash analysis program is shown in 
Figures 13.2 and 13.3. It should be noted that the text and color of the label in 
Figure 13.2 signifi es the “Danger” and states “energized work is prohibited” 
because the arc energy exceeds the 40 cal/cm2 for which no PPE is available.

The label shown in Figure 13.3 indicates PPE category 4 that the worker 
must use to perform work at this location. Both labels show the calculated 
fl ash protection boundary, incident energy, PPE category, glove  classifi cation, 
and shock protection boundaries per NFPA 70 E. The fi nal step in this pro-
cess is to give training to the employees on the arc-fl ash hazard, and how 
they should protect themselves.
13.3.1 Summary of NFPA 70, 70E, and OSHA Requirements
NFPA 70E and OSHA part 1910-132 require a hazard assessment for  electrical 
equipment and selection of appropriate PPE for the employees if they are to 
work on energized equipment. Further, NFPA 70 (National Electric Code) 
requires that the equipment has to be labeled to show the available arc energy 
and the category of PPE the person needs to wear before working on the 
equipment. The following overview is offered for the reader in order to under-
stand what is required by the above stated NFPA and OSHA requirements.
13.3.2 Overview of Arc-Flash Hazard
Arc-fl ash hazard is defi ned as a dangerous condition associated with the 
release of energy caused by an electric arc. The arc current creates a brilliant 
fl ash of light, a loud noise, intense heat, and a rapidly moving pressure wave. 
The products of arc-fault are ionized gases, metal vapors, molten metal drop-
lets, and shrapnel that shower the immediate vicinity of the arcing fault. The 
electrical arc burns make up a substantial portion of injuries from electrical 
malfunctions. The extremely high temperatures of the electrical arc can 
cause fatal and major burns at distances of 5–10 ft from the arcing equip-
ment. Therefore, the focus of industry on electrical safety and recognition of 
arc-fl ash burns as having great signifi cance highlighted the need for protect-
ing employees from all arc-fl ash hazards. The NEC-2008, Article 110-16 Flash 
protection, states in part that switchboards, panelboards, industrial control 
panels, and motor control centers that are in other than dwelling occupan-
cies and are likely to require examination, adjustment, servicing, or mainte-
nance while energized shall be fi eld marked to warn qualifi ed persons of 
potential electric arc-fl ash hazards. It is implied that fl ash protection is 
required when examining, adjusting, servicing, or maintaining energized 
equipment. The equipment shall be fi eld marked (labeled) to warn qualifi ed 
persons of potential electric arc-fl ash hazards. Let us now take a look at how 
the requirements for fi eld labeling of equipment can be accomplished.
In order to generate an arc fl ash hazard label, an arc-fl ash hazard  analysis 
study has to be conducted to determine the arc energy available at a given 
equipment. Therefore an arc-fl ash hazard analysis is performed in conjunc-
tion with the  short-circuit study and protective device  coordination study. 
Results of the short-circuit study are used to calculate the three-phase fault 
current from which the arcing fault current is  determined. Results of protec-
tive device coordination study are used to determine the time required for 
the electrical protective devices to clear the arcing fault current conditions. 

842 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Results of both short circuit and protective device coordination studies are 
used to perform an arc-fl ash hazard analysis. Results of arc-fl ash hazard anal-
ysis are used to identify the fl ash protection boundary and the incident energy 
at assigned working distances for the electrical equipment. The fl ash protec-
tion  boundary and the incident energy calculated in the arc-fl ash hazard 
analysis evaluation are based on taking credit for the protective relays and 
devices in  removing the arc. Therefore it is important that these  protective 
devices be kept in good working condition to maintain the validity of the arc-
fl ash hazard analysis results. Readers will fi nd useful information in Section 
1.9 in Chapter 1, where a discussion is provided on the bases of maintenance 
and testing of protective devices. In view of the requirements for arc-fl ash 
hazard analysis, it has become even more important now to maintain and test 
breakers and protective devices on a regular basis to ensure their reliability.
13.3.3 Arc-Flash Analysis
The arc-fl ash analysis is conducted by using a software program specifi cally 
developed to do the arc-fl ash analysis. The arc-fl ash software  programs are 
based on the methodologies given in IEEE-1584-2002 and the NFPA 70E 
 methodologies. The arc-fl ash software program is intended to provide guid-
ance based on the methodologies given in IEEE-1584–2002 and the NFPA 70E 
for the calculation of incident energy and arc-fl ash  protection boundaries. 
The results obtained from the arc-fl ash software program can be used as a 
basis to develop strategies that have the potential of minimizing burn  injuries. 
These strategies include specifying the rating of PPE, working only when the 
equipment is not energized, applying arc-resistance switchgear, and  following 
other good engineering techniques and work practices. The guide for arc-fl ash 
analysis presented in the IEEE-1584-2002, is based on testing and analysis of 
the hazard presented by incident energy. The potentially hazardous effects of 
molten metal splatter, projectiles, pressure impulses, and toxic arc by-products 
were not considered in the analysis methodology of IEEE-1584-2002. The soft-
ware programs based on the IEEE-1584-2002, provide analysis only for the 
hazards presented by incident energy and do not cover the potential hazards 
from molten metal splatter, projectiles, pressure impulses, and toxic arc 
 by-products. The PPE listing documented in the result of the arc-fl ash software 
program are not intended to prevent all injuries but to mitigate the impact of 
an arc fl ash upon a person, if one should occur. The selection of a level of PPE 
is based on NFPA 70E, Table 130.7(C)(11) using the results of the arc-fl ash 
 analysis. For conducting an arc-fl ash analysis, the  following steps are required:
Collect the system data
• 
Determine the system modes of operation
• 
Calculate the bolted fault currents
• 
Determine the arcing fault currents
• 
Determine protective device characteristics and the duration of the 
• 
arcs (clearing time of the protective devices)

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  843
Determine the system voltages and classes of equipment
• 
Select the working distances
• 
Determine the incident energy for all equipment
• 
Determine the fl ash boundary for all equipment
• 
Select PPE from the NFPA 70E-2004
• 
It should be noted that it takes an experienced engineer to implement the steps 
listed above for modeling the electrical power system, input the required 
system data, set the overcurrent relays and protective devices in the software 
program. After the short circuit and protective device coordination studies are 
completed then an arc fl ash hazard analysis study is conducted to calculate the 
various parameters of the arc fl ash hazard. The arc-fl ash software programs 
available on the market today will generate a report that provides detail 
 information on the various aspects of arc fl ash hazard analysis. A typical arc 
fl ash evaluation report includes the information listed in Table 13.3.

13.4 Electrical Safety Practices and Precautions
The methods and techniques discussed in this chapter are industry accepted 
practices for working in or around energized electric power lines and cir-
cuits, and should be used only as guidelines. National and local codes and 
rules and regulatory standards should always take precedence over the 
guidelines discussed in this chapter.
The following rules are basic to electrical accident prevention:
Know the work to be done and how to do it.
• 
Review working area for hazards of environment or facility design 
• 
that may exist in addition to those directly associated with the 
assigned work objective.
Wear fl ame-retardant coveralls and safety glasses plus other recom-
• 
mended protective devices/equipment. Refer to the PPE categories 
specifi ed under arc-fl ash hazard analysis for a specifi ed task.
Isolate (de-energize) the circuits and/or equipment to be worked.
• 
Lock out and tag all power sources and circuits to and from the 
• 
equipment/circuit to be worked on.
Test with two pretested testing devices for the presence of electrical 
• 
energy on circuits and/or equipment (both primary and secondary) 
while wearing electrical protective gloves.
Ground all sides of the work area with protective grounds applied 
• 
with hot sticks. All grounds must be visible at all times to those in 
the work area.
Enclose the work area with tape barrier.
• 
13.4.1 Electrical Safety
The following general guidelines are provided on on-site safety, work area con-
trol, lock-out and/or tagging, protective apparel, testing of energized circuits 
and equipment, rubber gloves, voltage testers and detectors, grounds, circuit 
breaker maintenance safety checklist, and entering confi ned spaces. These 
guidelines should be supplemented as required to meet the applicable codes 
and regulations including the PPE required per arc-fl ash hazard analysis.
13.4.2 “On-Site” Electrical Safety
Prior to going on an “on-site” electrical assignment, each worker should 
receive the following rules and should review and abide by them while on 
the assignment.
A foreman or qualifi ed employee should be designated for each on-site assign-
ment to provide on-site work direction and safety coordination. All personnel 
assigned to on-site electrical work should comply with the following directions:

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  845
Know the work content and work sequence, especially all safety 
• 
measures.
Know the proper tools and instruments required for the work, that 
• 
they have the full capability of safely performing the work, and that 
they are in good repair and/or are calibrated.
Check to determine that all de-energized circuits and equipment are 
• 
locked out and that grounds are placed on all sides of the work area 
prior to beginning work.
Segregate all work areas with barriers or tapes, confi ne all your activ-
• 
ities to these areas, and prevent unauthorized access to the area.
Insure that all energized circuits and equipment adjacent to the work 
• 
area are isolated, protected, or marked by at least two methods 
(e.g., rubber mats, tapes, signs, etc.) for personnel protection.
Do not perform work on energized circuits and equipment without 
• 
the direct authorization of your unit manager. When work on ener-
gized circuits and equipment has been authorized, use appropriate 
PPE required for the task, safety-tested equipment (i.e., rubber 
gloves, sleeves, mats, insulated tools, etc.).
Your foreman and qualifi ed employee must inform you of all changes 
• 
in work conditions. You then must repeat this information to your 
foreman and qualifi ed employee to insure your recognition and 
understanding of the condition.
Do not work alone; work with another worker or employee at all 
• 
times. Do not enter an energized area without direct permission 
from your foreman and qualifi ed employee.
Discuss each step of your work with your foreman and qualifi ed 
• 
employee before it is begun.
Do not directly touch an unconscious fellow worker since he or she 
• 
may be in contact with an energized circuit and equipment. Use an 
insulated device to remove him or her from the suspect area.
Do not perform, or continue to perform, any work when you are in 
• 
doubt about the safety procedure to be followed, the condition of the 
equipment, or any potential hazards. Perform this work only after you 
have obtained directions from your foreman and qualifi ed employee.
Do not work on, or adjacent to, any energized circuits and equipment 
• 
unless you feel alert and are in good health.

13.4.4 Work Area Control
When workers are setting up the control area, it should be standard pro cedure 
that the safety coordinator be present and provide the required information.
Tape—solid red: A red tape barrier (with safety cones and red fl ashing lights) 
must be used to enclose an area in which personnel will be working. Other 
persons may not enter the isolated area unless they are actively working 
in conjunction with the personnel on the assigned work.
The purpose of the solid red tape barrier is to enclose and isolate an area 
in which a hazard might exist for individuals unfamiliar with the equipment 
enclosed. The only persons permitted within the solid red barrier are indi-
viduals knowledgeable in the use and operation of the enclosed equipment.

Electrical Safety, Arc-Flash Hazard, Switching Practices, and Precautions  847
For their safety, workers shall not interest themselves in nor enter any area 
not enclosed by the red tape barrier except for a defi ned route to enter and 
leave the site.
It is important that the tape barrier is strictly controlled and the restric-
tions regarding its use are enforced.
When any workers are using solid red tape to enclose an area, the following 
requirements must be satisfi ed:
Place the tape so that it completely encloses the area or equipment 
where the hazard exists.
Place the tape so that it is readily visible from all avenues of approach 
and at such a level that it forms an effective barrier.
Be certain that the area enclosed by the tape is large enough to give 
adequate clearance between the hazard and any personnel working 
in the tape enclosed area.
Arrange the tape so any test equipment for the setup can be operated 
safely from outside the enclosed area.
Use the tape to prevent the area from being entered by persons unfa-
miliar with the work and associated hazards. Do not use the tape for 
any other purpose.
Remove the tape when the hazard no longer exists and the work 
is completed.
It shall be standard procedure that the workers should consider all areas out-
side the red barrier work area as energized and undertake no investigation 
unless accompanied by a knowledgeable plant employee.
Tape—white with a red stripe: White tape with a red stripe is used to enclose 
and isolate a temporary hazard (mechanical or electrical). No one is to enter 
this enclosed area. Obviously, if the enclosing of a hazardous area with tape 
is to be protective, the use of the tape barrier should be controlled and the 
restrictions on entering the area strictly enforced.
When any personnel are using white tape with a red stripe, the following 
requirements must be satisfi ed:
Place the tape so that it completely encloses the area or equipment 
where the hazard exists.
Place the tape so that it is readily visible from all avenues of approach 
and at such a level that it forms an effective barrier.
Be certain that the area enclosed is large enough to give adequate clear-
ance between the hazard and any personnel outside the enclosed area.
Arrange the tape so that the test equipment for the setup can be 
operated outside the enclosed area.
Use the tape only to isolate a temporary mechanical or electrical hazard; 
do not use the tape for any other purpose.

848 
Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing
Consider a striped tape area similar to an interlocked enclosure and 
treat as such.
Remove the tape when the hazard no longer exists.
13.4.5 Lock-Out and/or Tagging
For the protection of personnel working on electrical conductor and/or 
equipment, locks must be placed on all open isolation devices designed to 
receive them. “DANGER” tags signed by the foreman or qualifi ed employee 
must also be placed on the open isolation device.
Danger Tags: Danger tags may be applied only by authorized personnel 
and the tags must be dated and signed by the person applying the tag. 
The  following requirements must be satisfi ed when danger tags are used:
Danger tags are to be used only for personnel protection when the per-
sonnel are required to work on or near equipment that, if operated, might 
cause injury.
Danger tags are attached to primary disconnecting devices as a means of 
locking out equipment. Tag each source of power to the equipment and asso-
ciated feeds (instrumentation circuits, PT’s, CT’s, etc.) to the equipment which 
is to be locked out.
Danger tags should be left on the equipment only while the personnel are 
working on the equipment or when a hazard to the personnel exists. A device 
bearing a danger tag must not be operated at any time (Figure 13.4).
Out of order tags: Out of order tags are used to restrict the operation of 
equipment which has a mechanical defect or for other reasons that are not 
related to the safety of personnel. Complete information concerning the rea-
sons for the tag and a list of all persons authorized to operate the tagged 
device must be written on the tag (Figure 13.5).
Out of service tags: Out of service tags are used to indicate equipment that 
has been taken out of service. It is a white tag with letters on a black 
background.
